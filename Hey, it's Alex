Hey, it's Alex.

I've built quite a few tools this year—like this one.

People often ask me:
“What actions actually drive conversions?”
“How can I get more conversions?”

The answer is always the same: It depends on your data.

You're posting daily on LinkedIn, sending email campaigns...
And you want to know exactly which actions are generating sales or subscribers.

If you're like me, you're sharing lots of links every day:
Landing pages, sales pages, blog posts, videos—you name it.

But here's the catch:

Most tools track clicks, not conversions.
They don't show you who signed up, who bought your product, or who subscribed.

I had the same frustration.
I wanted to know precisely what actions were driving real results.

Since I couldn't find a tool that tracked conversions directly...
I decided to build it myself.

Let me show you PIMMS in two minutes.

First, on the dashboard, you get an overview of every link you've shared.
You see all the usual data: clicks, cities, countries...

But more importantly—you see the conversions each link generated:
form submissions, newsletter sign-ups, sales—everything.

With this, you can finally understand what actions really convert,
so you can optimize your strategy and grow faster.

Links created with PIMMS are called deeplinks.
Deeplinks automatically boost your mobile conversions compared to regular links—
a major advantage if you're selling online.

So, the main benefit of PIMMS is clear:
You grow faster because you know exactly what's working.
No more guessing—just data-driven decisions.

PIMMS is live right now.
As I'm recording this video, it's still in beta—so the price is really low.

Your feedback is essential to making PIMMS the best analytics tool out there.

I'll see you on the other side!
