Hey, it's Alex

You’re asking yourself:
“What actions drive more conversions?”
“How can I convert more?”

The answer always depends on your data.

You’re posting daily on LinkedIn, running email campaigns—you want to know which actions are actually generating sales or new subscribers.

If you are like me, you share a lot of links every days for your landing pages, blog posts, videos and more

But here's the problem:

Most tools track clicks. They don’t tell you who actually signed up or bought.

“But I still want to know what’s working…”

Same here. I couldn’t find a tool that connects my actions to real conversions— so I setup it myself.

Let me show you PIMMS in two minutes.

First, on the dashboard, you’ll see an overview of every link you've shared. For each link, you have analytics. It shows you clicks, cities, or countries, and more.
You can see conversions for every link you have shared — like form submissions, newsletter sign-ups, or sales.

You will learn what actions you take generate more conversions, so you can improve and grow. 

Now, links you create on PIMMS are called deeplinks. They are the best type of links to increase mobile conversions. It’s a huge advantage for anyone selling online.

The core benefit of PIMMS is clear: Actionable insights on clicks and real conversions combined with powerful deeplinks. You can finally boost engagement, increase conversions, and grow your business with clarity and confidence.
PIMMS is live right now. As I'm recording this, it's still in beta—which means pricing is especially affordable. Your feedback is crucial to making PIMMS the best analytics tool possible.
I'll see you on the other side!
