- Open the [Cal.com Ã— PiMMs Zapier template](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=255624056).
- Click **Use this Zap**.

### 6\. Set up your Zap step-by-step

- Map the fields properly:
  - **Click ID:** the Cal.com `pimms_id` field (must be a random-looking string, not "pimms_id" itself).
  - **External ID:** the attendee's email address.
  - **Email:** attendee's email.
  - **Name:** attendee's name.

### âš¡ Important notes

- If someone books multiple times using the same email, only the first meeting is counted as a conversion.
- Always make sure the `pimms_id` is correctly prefilled on the Cal.com form.

### Troubleshooting tips

If your Zap fails:

- Check Zapier **Task History** to view detailed errors.
- Common issues:
  - **Missing or invalid `pimms_id`**
  - **Incorrect field mapping**

In case of errors, revisit your Cal.com form setup and Zapier mapping.
