### 4\. Book a dummy meeting to test

- Click on your PiMMs short link.
- Book a test meeting using a dummy email address.

This is crucial so Zapier can detect the `pimms_id` correctly in the next steps.

### 5\. Use the Zapier template

Simplify everything by using our ready-made Zap template:

- Open the [Cal.com √ó PiMMs Zapier template](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=255624056).
- Click **Use this Zap**.

### 6\. Set up your Zap step-by-step

- Set **Cal.com** as the trigger, and event as **Booking Created**.
- Connect your Cal.com account.

![Connect Cal.com](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-connect-cal.webp)

- Select your dummy meeting when prompted for a test record.

![Zapier find dummy record](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-find-dummy-record.webp)

- Set **PiMMs** as the action app and select **Create Conversion**.

![Zapier action create conversion](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-action-create-conversion.webp)

- Authorize PiMMs if prompted.

![Zapier approve permissions](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-approve-permissions.webp)

- Map the fields properly:
  - **Click ID:** the Cal.com `pimms_id` field (must be a random-looking string, not "pimms_id" itself).
  - **External ID:** the attendee's email address.
  - **Email:** attendee's email.
  - **Name:** attendee's name.

![Zapier field mapping](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-field-mapping.webp)

![Zapier field mapping others](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-field-mapping-others.webp)

- Double-check your mappings.
- Skip the test step if you want, and publish your Zap.

### 7\. Final test to confirm everything works

- Book a new dummy meeting using your PiMMs link.
- Check your PiMMs dashboard to verify the booking was tracked as a conversion.

### ‚ö° Important notes

- If someone books multiple times using the same email, only the first meeting is counted as a conversion.
- Always make sure the `pimms_id` is correctly prefilled on the Cal.com form.

### Troubleshooting tips

If your Zap fails:

- Check Zapier **Task History** to view detailed errors.
- Common issues:
  - **Missing or invalid `pimms_id`**
  - **Incorrect field mapping**

In case of errors, revisit your Cal.com form setup and Zapier mapping.

### 8. The best ways to share your Cal.com link and track conversions

#### ‚úÖ Option A: Share your PiMMs short link (recommended)

- Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io) and create a short link pointing to your Cal.com booking URL.
- Enable **Conversion tracking**.
- Share your PiMMs link via email, LinkedIn, QR codes, or A/B tests.

Example:
```
https://pim.ms/your-link
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Option B: Share your own website, not the PiMMs link directly

If your Cal.com calendar is embedded on your website (e.g., Webflow, Wix, Framer), you should **not** paste a PiMMs short link directly into your HTML code.

**Why?**  
If you embed a PiMMs link inside your site, every visitor will be tracked as if they came from that exact link ‚Äî even if they originally discovered your website through another campaign. This breaks PiMMs‚Äô ability to attribute the visit correctly.

**Instead, do this:**

- Keep your usual Cal.com link in the HTML, but **append `?pimms_id=1`** at the end:

```html
<a href="https://cal.com/your-name/meeting?pimms_id=1">Book now</a>
```

- Then add these scripts to your site‚Äôs `<head>` section or global HTML settings:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

üí° Now, when someone visits your site via a PiMMs short link, the scripts will detect the visitor‚Äôs `pimms_id` and inject it into your Cal.com link dynamically. This ensures every booking is properly attributed to the correct campaign.

---

#### ‚úÖ Option C: Generate Cal links dynamically (for developers)

If you're using frameworks like **Next.js**, **Nuxt**, or **Rails**, you can construct Cal.com URLs on the fly using the `pimms_id` from cookies or URL params:

```js
const pimmsId = getCookie("pimms_id");
const calUrl = `https://cal.com/your-name/meeting?pimms_id=${pimmsId}`;
```

Use this URL in buttons, modals, redirects, or dynamic components.
