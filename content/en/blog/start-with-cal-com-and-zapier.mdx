- Save your form changes.

### 3\. Create a tracking link in PiMMs

Before testing bookings, you need to create a tracking link within PiMMs:

- Log into your PiMMs dashboard.
- Create a new tracking link, pointing to your Cal.com booking URL.
- Ensure that **conversion tracking** is enabled for this link.

### 4\. Create a dummy booking

It's essential to test your setup using the tracking link created in PiMMs:

- Click your PiMMs-generated short link to reach the Cal.com booking form.
- Make a test booking using a dummy email.
- Ensure the booking completes successfully.

This ensures the `pimms_id` is captured correctly for Zapier integration.

### 5\. Use the Zapier template

Simplify integration by using a Zapier template:

- Open the [Cal.com √ó PiMMs Zapier template](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=255624056).
- Click **Use this Zap**.

### 6\. Set up the Zapier integration

- Confirm the trigger is **Cal.com** and the event is **Booking Created**.
- Connect your Cal.com account, then click **Continue**.

![Connect Cal.com](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-connect-cal.webp)

- Choose your dummy booking for the test:
  - Click **Find new records** to refresh the booking list.
  - Select the dummy booking.
  - Verify that `pimms_id` is listed.

![Zapier find dummy record](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-find-dummy-record.webp)

- Check that the action app is set to **PiMMs** and the action is **Create Conversion**.

![Zapier action selection to create conversion](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-action-create-conversion.webp)

- Select your PiMMs account and approve permissions on pimms dashboard.

![Zapier approve permissions](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-approve-permissions.webp)

- Map the Cal.com `pimms_id` to PiMMs‚Äô **Click ID** carefully.
- Ensure the value is a random string not "pimms_id" or empty.

![Zapier field mapping](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-field-mapping.webp)

- Do the same for the other input fields:
  - **External ID** must be set to the **email**
  - **Email** to the email of the person booking
  - **Name** to the name of the person booking

![Zapier field mapping other fields](https://assets.pimms.io/zapier-field-mapping-others.webp)

- Finally, check that the values are correctly mapped. You can skip the test step. And publish the Zap.

### 7\. Test your Zap

- Make another dummy booking via your PiMMs-generated short link.
- Check your PiMMs dashboard to ensure the booking is tracked as a conversion.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notes

- Duplicate bookings (same email) count as one conversion; PiMMs ignores repeat bookings by the same email.

### Debugging integration errors

If your Zap fails:

- Book another test using a new dummy email.
- In Zapier, navigate to **History**.
- Identify failed runs and check the error message.

Common issues include:

- **Missing or incorrect `pimms_id`:** Verify the field matches exactly.
- **`pimms_id` not found:** Indicates configuration errors; revisit steps 2-6.

If problems persist, ensure your Cal.com form and Zapier setup match precisely as described above.
