## Main Features of No-Code Deep Linking

No-code deep linking platforms are a game-changer for businesses looking to create seamless mobile user experiences. These tools allow companies to design smart links that guide users efficiently, without the need for complex coding.

### Link Creation and Settings

No-code platforms simplify the process of creating smart links with user-friendly drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built templates. According to [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/) research, these tools can speed up development by as much as 20 times compared to traditional coding methods [\[2\]](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/build/what-is-low-code-no-code.html).

Some standout customization features include:

- **Campaign tracking parameters (UTMs)** to monitor performance.
- **Custom domains** for branded, professional-looking links.
- **QR code generation** for bridging offline and online campaigns.
- **A/B testing tools** to refine link performance.
- **Personalized user journey mapping** for tailored experiences.

Take PIMMS, for example. It allows users to create smart links that seamlessly guide people to mobile apps like YouTube, Amazon, and Vinted. On top of that, it provides real-time analytics to track how these links perform across different channels.

### Platform Support

Deep linking isn’t just about creating links - it’s about ensuring they work smoothly across all devices and platforms. Modern no-code tools handle the technical heavy lifting by offering:

- **Universal Links** for iOS devices.
- **Android App Links** for Android systems.
- **URI schemes** for older devices.
- **Web fallback options** for users without the app.

This robust support system ensures that links perform consistently, no matter the platform. And the results speak for themselves: deep linking can boost click-to-install conversion rates by up to 6X compared to generic experiences [\[5\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/deep-linking). Specific journeys, like web-to-app and QR-to-app, see even higher success rates, with 27% and 33% click-to-install rates respectively [\[5\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/deep-linking).

### Backup Options

What happens if a user doesn’t have the app installed? No problem. These systems check for the app first, redirect users to the app store if needed, and then guide them to the desired content - or a web alternative if necessary.

This thoughtful approach significantly improves user engagement. Activation and retention rates double [\[3\]](https://www.helpshift.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-deep-linking-making-it-work-for-your-mobile-app), and users visit apps twice as frequently. When executed well, deep linking strategies can have a major impact on user behavior and overall performance across platforms.

## Conversion Impact of Deep Links

### User Experience Flow

Deep links make navigating between platforms and apps smoother for users. When done right, these links ensure the context of a user’s journey is preserved, reducing drop-offs along the way. Studies reveal that deep linking can boost conversion rates by up to 40% compared to traditional links [\[7\]](https://www.mobot.io/blog/how-deep-links-affect-the-app-journey).

What’s more, deep links can double retention rates by keeping users engaged longer and encouraging them to complete more actions. By maintaining intent and guiding users directly to the most relevant content, these links create a seamless experience. This approach also opens doors to highly targeted marketing strategies.

> "Deep links are simply the best way to build a quality, connected user experience that will bring in new customers and keep the ones you have engaged and happy." - Megan Dobransky, Branch [\[6\]](https://www.branch.io/resources/blog/deep-linking-benefits-and-best-practices)

### Custom Marketing Campaigns

Deep linking doesn’t just improve navigation - it’s a game-changer for personalized marketing. Platforms like PIMMS allow marketers to create tailored campaigns based on user behavior and preferences. These journeys guide users straight to the right spot in apps like YouTube, Amazon, or Vinted, enhancing engagement and conversions.

The results of deep-linked campaigns speak for themselves:

| Metric                          | Impact      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Average Conversion Increase** | 66%         |
| **Purchase Likelihood**         | 2x higher   |
| **Average Spend**               | 2.7x higher |
| **30-Day Retention**            | 110% lift   |

Take [MakeMyTrip](https://www.makemytrip.com/), for example - India’s largest online travel company. By using deep-linked web-to-app smart banners, they saw measurable success:

- **15% increase in one-day retention**
- **13% increase in one-week retention**
- **12% increase in one-month retention** [\[8\]](https://www.branch.io/resources/blog/the-role-of-deep-linking-in-mobile-marketing-campaigns)

### Performance Tracking

Targeted campaigns are only as good as the data behind them, and that’s where precise performance tracking comes into play. PIMMS offers tools to monitor clicks, leads, conversions, and sales across all channels. This data helps marketers fine-tune their strategies, identifying what works and where adjustments are needed.

Key metrics to keep an eye on include:

- Click-through rates across platforms
- Conversion rates for specific user groups
- Retention rates over time
- Revenue attribution by channel

Failing to implement effective deep linking can lead to wasted ad spend - up to 15% - and reduce customer lifetime value by 10-15% [\[7\]](https://www.mobot.io/blog/how-deep-links-affect-the-app-journey). PIMMS addresses this with advanced filtering tools, allowing teams to break down performance data by UTM parameters, traffic sources, devices, and even location. These insights enable marketers to fine-tune campaigns for specific audiences and maximize ROI across the board.

## Deep Linking Examples

### Online Store Links

Deep linking is a game-changer for e-commerce, allowing users to jump straight to the content they need. This targeted approach makes users **2.5 times more likely to complete a purchase** compared to browsing through general links [\[1\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/glossary/deep-linking).

For instance, a leading fashion retailer used deep links in cart recovery emails and saw impressive results - **45% email open rates** and **21% click-through rates** [\[5\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/deep-linking). Similarly, PIMMS utilizes deep linking to send shoppers directly to specific product pages within popular apps, keeping their purchase intent intact and boosting conversions.

Now, let’s look at how deep links shine in marketing messages.

### Marketing Messages

Deep links are transforming direct messaging campaigns, making email and SMS marketing more effective. By integrating personalized links, businesses can create seamless user experiences.

Take Int Bank, for example. They use personalized deep links in SMS reminders, allowing customers to pick up exactly where they left off in their applications [\[5\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/deep-linking). Another example is Yummly, a recipe and grocery platform. They include deep links in their email campaigns, guiding users directly to in-app recipes. From there, users can instantly create shopping lists or order ingredients [\[4\]](https://bitly.com/blog/mobile-deep-linking).

### Physical Marketing Tools

Deep linking isn’t just for digital platforms - it bridges the gap between offline and online experiences through tools like QR codes and NFC tags. Here's how some major brands are using these technologies:

| Brand                                                                                              | Implementation                                  | Results                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Adidas](https://www.adidas.com/us)                                                                | NFC tag in the tongue of Speedfactory AM4 shoes | Access to exclusive content                                                                |
| [Spyder](https://www.spyder.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor7rjfxXTSBY90-n4Yis69-Hq2bgV9JKlA9mq60ASDeog8oOCgp) | QR code on U.S. ski team jacket hang tags       | Instant access to product information                                                      |
| Int Bank                                                                                           | QR code on desktop homepage                     | 33% click-to-install rate [\[5\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/deep-linking) |

These tools work best when paired with clear instructions. For example, Adidas includes specific directions on product stickers, encouraging users to tap the NFC tag for a more interactive experience [\[10\]](https://academy.bluebite.com/posts/how-to-create-an-effective-call-to-action-for-a-qr-code-and-nfc-tag). PIMMS also supports this offline-to-online transition by offering customizable QR codes that link users directly to specific in-app content.

Deep linking, whether through digital campaigns or physical tools, creates smoother journeys for users, making every interaction more engaging and efficient.
