- Copy the generated payment link URL (e.g., `https://buy.stripe.com/xyz`).

### 3. The best ways to share your Stripe payment link and track sales (A, B, or C)

#### âœ… Option A: Share a PiMMs short link (recommended)

This is the easiest and most powerful method.

- Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io) and create a short link.
- Paste your Stripe payment link (e.g. `https://buy.stripe.com/xyz`).
- Enable **Conversion tracking**.

PiMMs will automatically add the right `client_reference_id` to every visit, so you donâ€™t need to edit the link manually.

**Why use this method?**
- It works across all channels: email, LinkedIn, QR codes, paid ads.
- Youâ€™ll know exactly which campaign, post, or message generated the sale.

Example:
```
https://pim.ms/xyz
```

#### âœ… Option B: Embed Stripe on your website (no short link)

If you embed your Stripe payment link inside your own website (e.g. Webflow, Wix, Framer), **donâ€™t paste a PiMMs link into the HTML**.

**Why?**
If you hardcode a PiMMs short link, PiMMs canâ€™t differentiate between visitors. All purchases will appear to come from the same source.

**Do this instead:**
- Use your standard Stripe link in the button, but **append `?pimms_client_reference_id=1`** to the URL:

```html
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?pimms_client_reference_id=1">Buy now</a>
```

- Then, in your websiteâ€™s global HTML, include the following scripts:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

These scripts detect which PiMMs link brought the visitor to your site and inject the correct tracking ID into your Stripe link.

ðŸ’¡ **This preserves attribution across campaigns while keeping your own domain.**

#### âœ… Option C: Generate payment links dynamically (for developers)

If you're using **Next.js**, **Nuxt**, or another modern web framework:

```js
const pimmsId = getCookie("pimms_id");
const paymentLink = `https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?client_reference_id=pimms_id_${pimmsId}`;
window.open(paymentLink, "_blank");
```

This method gives you full control: the PiMMs ID is dynamically appended before redirecting to Stripe.
