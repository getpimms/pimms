## Setup Requirements and Tools

To get started with tracking conversions effectively, you'll need a few tools. PIMMS simplifies the process by reducing the technical setup while offering detailed tracking capabilities.

### Create and Configure [PIMMS](https://pimms.io/)

![PIMMS](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b68494fa53d42207bc3c7/3894d0847391c6f45cb96ad5842b1908.jpg)

Here’s how to set up PIMMS step by step:

- **Create an account**: Sign up for PIMMS and log in to access your dashboard.
- **Add the script**: Place the following code inside your website's `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="https://pimms.io/track.js"></script>
```

- **Set your preferences**: Configure your conversion tracking settings to suit your needs.

The [PIMMS script](https://preview.pimms.io/) takes care of tracking user interactions and form submissions across different platforms automatically. However, you’ll need to verify and adjust platform-specific settings to finalize the setup.

### Form Platform Setup Checklist

Here’s a quick guide to configuring PIMMS for popular form platforms:

| Platform | Required Setup               | Key Configuration                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Webflow  | SDK Installation             | Add the PIMMS script to the site header |
| Tally    | Google Analytics Integration | Enable GA (even with a placeholder ID)  |
| Typeform | Google Tag Manager           | Install GTM on your website             |

#### Platform-Specific Instructions

- **Tally Forms**:  
  Enable Google Analytics integration in the settings menu. Note: Avoid using Google Tag Manager directly within Tally [\[3\]](https://tally.so/help/tracking-tally-form-conversions-with-google-tag-manager).
- **Typeform**:  
  Install Google Tag Manager on your main website and set up a dedicated "Typeform submit listener" tag [\[4\]](https://conversiontracking.io/blog/typeform-google-ads-conversion-tracking-guide).
- **Webflow**:  
  Add the `?pimms_id=1` parameter to your form links for proper tracking [\[2\]](https://pimms.io/guides/how-to-track-conversions-on-vibe-coding-ai-no-code-sites).

Once everything is set up, you can monitor conversions in real time and gain insights into user behavior and form completion rates through the PIMMS dashboard.

## 3-Minute Tracking Implementation

Get conversion tracking up and running for Webflow, Tally, and Typeform in just a few minutes with PIMMS. Here's how to do it step by step.

### [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) Form Tracking

![Webflow](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b68494fa53d42207bc3c7/0e5e58cf00c947b71dd7e40753f1d062.jpg)

Start by adding the [PIMMS tracking script](https://pimms.io/blog) to the `<head>` section of your Webflow site:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

Next, update your form links by appending the PIMMS parameter. For example, your link might look like this: `https://yourwebflow.com/form?pimms_id=1`. This ensures precise attribution for your form submissions.

To confirm everything is working, open your browser's console and type:

```
window._pimmsAnalytics
```

If the setup is correct, you’ll see values displayed. Once Webflow is set up, you can move on to Tally for seamless tracking.

### [Tally](https://tally.so/) Form Tracking

![Tally](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b68494fa53d42207bc3c7/9084be8927c29ad7d5562dcfebf39bf7.jpg)

To [track conversions](/articles/start-with-zapier) in Tally, create a new Zap using Tally.so as the trigger app. Configure it to activate whenever there’s a new form submission. Then, set PIMMS as the action app and select "Create Conversion." This makes it easy to capture form submissions and attribute them accurately.

Now, let’s look at how to integrate tracking with Typeform.

### [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) Tracking

![Typeform](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b68494fa53d42207bc3c7/c6ba0e8b62cda4ded7558be4fc0eb847.jpg)

1.  Open the form's **Logic** panel and enable "Pull data in" along with [Source tracking UTMs](/articles/utm-guide).
2.  Save your changes and publish the form to activate tracking.

With PIMMS, you'll automatically collect details like traffic sources, campaign parameters, device types, and location data. This provides a clear and detailed view of your conversion performance without any extra effort.

## Advanced Tracking Features

Take your conversion tracking to the next level with advanced features in PIMMS, designed to give you deeper insights into your marketing efforts.

### UTM Parameter Setup

PIMMS makes it easy to track the performance of your marketing campaigns by capturing UTM parameters. Here’s how you can set it up:

1.  Add UTM parameters to the URLs of your forms. For example:

    ```
    https://yourform.com?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=spring2025
    ```

2.  In your PIMMS dashboard, go to **Advanced Settings** > **UTM Configuration** and enable UTM tracking.

Once configured, PIMMS will automatically track key details like:

- **Campaign source** (e.g., newsletter, social media)
- **Medium** (e.g., email, paid ads)
- **Campaign name** (e.g., spring2025)
- **Content variations** (e.g., different ad creatives)
- **Term targeting** (e.g., specific keywords)

These insights will appear in your analytics dashboard, allowing you to filter and compare conversions across marketing channels and campaigns. For instance, you can analyze how many form submissions came from your email campaigns versus social media ads. With UTM tracking, you’ll have a clearer picture of your marketing performance across all user touchpoints.

### Cross-Platform User Journey Tracking

To track the entire customer journey, install the PIMMS tracking script on all your web pages:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

Make sure to pass user identifiers on the form platforms you use:

- **Webflow**: Enable "Store submission data"
- **Tally**: Activate "Track respondent info"
- **Typeform**: Turn on "Identify respondents"

This setup allows PIMMS to link user interactions across platforms, giving you a comprehensive view of the customer journey. You’ll gain insights such as:

- The time it takes from the first form view to submission
- How many interactions happen before a conversion
- Common patterns in form submissions
- Device usage trends during the conversion process

For even more detailed analysis, PIMMS integrates seamlessly with tools like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), connecting your marketing efforts directly to revenue data. This unified tracking helps you understand not just where your leads come from, but also how they contribute to your bottom line.

## Testing and Error Resolution

Once your form tracking setup is complete, it's essential to confirm that everything is functioning as intended and to address any issues that may arise. Below are key steps for testing and resolving common tracking problems.

### Track and Verify Conversions

To ensure accurate tracking, use your PIMMS dashboard and follow these steps:

- **Test Form Submissions**  
  Submit test entries while monitoring PIMMS in real time. Check that:

  - Form submissions appear immediately in your conversion feed.
  - UTM parameters are recorded accurately.
  - User journey data is visible in the analytics view.
  - Cross-platform tracking links operate correctly.

- **Cross-Platform Verification**  
  Run tests on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), mobile devices (iOS, Android), and across various screen resolutions.
- **Data Validation**  
  Compare conversion data from PIMMS with your CRM and form platform analytics. Ensure that user identification remains consistent across all touchpoints.

If any discrepancies arise, refer to the troubleshooting tips below.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Consent Mode Problems**  
Incorrect consent implementation can interfere with tracking [\[5\]](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/google-ads-conversion-tracking-not-working). Make sure your consent management system:

- Properly triggers `ad_storage` and `ad_user_data` permissions.
- Offers a clear and accessible consent interface.
- Ensures tracking consistency across all platforms where forms are hosted.

**Script Conflicts**  
If tracking stops working, check the following:

- Look for JavaScript errors in the browser console.
- Verify that the PIMMS script is correctly placed on your site.
- Disable ad blockers and retest.

> "Never rely solely on platform-specific conversion data for reporting total conversions, sales, or ROI, especially if you're a multi-channel B2C marketer or a B2B marketer." - Matt Butler, CEO, Bonsai Data Solutions [\[6\]](https://bonsai.llc/insights/the-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-and-fixing-conversion-tracking-issues)

**Cross-Domain Tracking Issues**  
For forms embedded on multiple domains:

- Ensure the PIMMS tracking script is installed on all relevant pages.
- Confirm that user identifiers persist across domains.
- Verify that UTM parameters transfer correctly between domains.

**Browser Protection Challenges**  
Test your forms in private/incognito mode and with popular ad blockers enabled. Also, check that your Content Security Policy (CSP) allows PIMMS scripts to run.

If you notice a sudden drop in conversion data, investigate these potential causes:

- Recent changes to website code.
- Updates to your form platform.
- Incorrect placement of the PIMMS script.
- Error messages in the browser console.

## Conclusion: Next Steps with PIMMS

With form tracking in place, you can use PIMMS to drive higher conversions. For instance, branded deep links have been shown to increase click-through rates by more than 34% [\[1\]](https://slashdot.org/software/p/PIMMS).

Here’s how you can get started with your first PIMMS campaign:

- **Launch Your First Campaign**: Create a PIMMS short link with UTM parameters to track conversions accurately. For example, China Expat Health saw a 79% jump in lead conversion rates by using strategic messaging [\[8\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide).
- **Test Implementation**: Run tests across various devices and browsers to ensure smooth functionality. [Bombas](https://bombas.com/), for instance, boosted logins by 36% and saw a 4.1% increase in orders by fine-tuning their CTAs [\[8\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide).
- **Track and Optimize**: Use the PIMMS dashboard to monitor form performance in real time. [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/) successfully captured 271 new leads in a single month with a 10.8% conversion rate [\[8\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide).

To refine your campaigns further, consider these optimization tips:

- Use dynamic content tailored to user behavior
- Experiment with different CTA variations
- Track form completion rates in real time
- Identify and address drop-off points using PIMMS analytics

Even small adjustments can yield big results. For example, Morningstar increased CTA clicks by 44.11% simply by changing their button text from "Contact us" to "Inquire now" [\[7\]](https://vwo.com/conversion-rate-optimization/conversion-rate-optimisation-tips).

Your PIMMS dashboard is your go-to tool for tracking and improving form performance, helping you make informed decisions that lead to better conversions.
