**Revenue Per Click (RPC)** shows how much money you make from each click on your campaigns. For example, if 5,935 clicks generate $264 in sales, your RPC is **$0.04 per click**. Tracking RPC helps you measure campaign performance, improve ROI, and make data-driven decisions.

### Key Steps to Track RPC:

- **Set Up First-Party Tracking**: Install scripts, define conversion events, and track revenue accurately.
- **[Use UTM Parameters](https://pimms.io/blog/utm-builder-guide)**: Organize campaigns with UTM tags like `utm_source`, `utm_campaign`, etc.
- **Connect Clicks to Revenue**: Use tools like [PIMMS](https://pimms.io/) to map clicks to sales, segment data, and analyze performance.

### Metrics to Monitor Alongside RPC:

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Measures link effectiveness.
- **Conversion Rate**: Tracks how many clicks turn into sales.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Shows revenue per transaction.
- **Time to Convert**: Measures the sales cycle length.

### Boost Your RPC:

- Test and optimize landing pages.
- Segment audiences by campaign, location, or device.
- Adjust ad spend based on real-time performance data.

Tracking RPC helps you focus on what works, fine-tune campaigns, and increase revenue per click effectively.

## Set Up RPC Tracking

To track Revenue Per Click (RPC), you'll need to configure scripts, define parameters, and connect clicks to revenue data.

### Add First-Party Tracking

Start by implementing first-party tracking on your site:

- Install tracking scripts directly on your website.
- Define conversion events for important user actions.
- Configure parameters to track revenue.
- Test everything to ensure data is being captured accurately.

This setup ensures your tracking code captures both clicks and revenue-related actions, giving you a full picture of the conversion process.

### Set Up UTM Parameters

PIMMS simplifies UTM tracking with built-in tools. Use the following structure to organize your campaigns:

| Parameter        | Example          | Purpose                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **utm_source**   | facebook         | Identifies traffic origin   |
| **utm_medium**   | cpc              | Specifies marketing method  |
| **utm_campaign** | summer_sale_2025 | Names the promotion         |
| **utm_content**  | blue_button      | Highlights creative element |
| **utm_term**     | running_shoes    | Tracks keywords used        |

Once your UTM parameters are set, link them directly to sales data in PIMMS for deeper insights.

Here’s how to connect clicks to revenue in PIMMS:

**Enable Conversion Tracking**  
Activate conversion tracking to tie revenue to specific events.

**Set Up Sales Attribution**  
Use PIMMS' real-time analytics to map clicks to sales effectively.

**Apply Advanced Filtering**  
Break down your data by:

- Campaigns (via UTM parameters)
- Traffic sources
- Geographic regions
- Device types
- Browser preferences

This segmentation helps pinpoint which campaigns and sources drive the most revenue per click.

## Track and Analyze RPC

### How to Calculate RPC

Revenue Per Click (RPC) is determined by dividing your total revenue by the total number of clicks. For instance, if your campaign brought in $2,640 from 5,935 clicks, your RPC would be $0.44 ($2,640 ÷ 5,935). Tools like PIMMS calculate this metric in real time, making it easier to monitor.

### Other Key Metrics to Monitor

In addition to RPC, keep an eye on these metrics to get a clearer picture of your campaign's performance:

| Metric                   | What It Measures          | Example                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR) | Effectiveness of links    | 3.2% of email recipients clicked    |
| Conversion Rate          | Quality of visitors       | 15% of clicks turned into customers |
| Average Order Value      | Impact on total revenue   | $125 per transaction                |
| Time to Convert          | Length of the sales cycle | 2.4 days from click to purchase     |

Evaluating these metrics can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your campaigns.

### Breaking Down the Data

To uncover specific opportunities, segment your RPC data by campaign, device, and region. For example, PIMMS data shows conversion rates can vary significantly by channel:

- **LinkedIn**: 76% of conversions
- **[Calendly](https://calendly.com/)**: 12% of conversions
- **Twitter**: 7.3% of conversions
- **Instagram**: 3.9% of conversions
- **Google**: 1.6% of conversions

**Campaign Insights**  
Use UTM parameters to track the performance of different campaigns. For example, compare campaigns like `summer_sale_2025` and `webinar_jean` to see which generates the highest RPC. Breaking down performance by campaign, device, and region helps you identify top-performing segments and areas for improvement.

## Increase Your RPC

### Test Landing Pages

Make sure links direct users to official mobile apps to minimize friction. PIMMS's smart link technology automatically routes users to the correct app across more than 100 platforms.

- **Set Up Link Variants**  
  Create multiple landing page versions to test key elements. PIMMS's tracking tools let you see which versions generate the most conversions.
- **Monitor User Behavior**  
  Keep an eye on these metrics to optimize your pages:

  | Metric             | What to Analyze                     | Action Items                               |
  | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
  | Time on Page       | How engaged users are               | Adjust content length and placement        |
  | Drop-off Points    | Where users leave                   | Eliminate friction in conversion steps     |
  | Device Performance | Mobile vs. desktop conversion rates | Optimize layout for top-performing devices |

Refining your landing pages will help you better target your audience and increase RPC.

### Improve Audience Targeting

Knowing how your audience behaves is crucial for improving RPC. PIMMS's filtering tools let you segment users by UTM campaigns, traffic sources, geographic areas, devices, browsers, and marketing channels.

Use this data to focus on the channels that consistently drive conversions.

### Adjust Marketing Spend

Once you've fine-tuned your campaigns, use real-time data to adjust your marketing budget. Keep performance insights at the center of your strategy.

- Track campaigns live to tweak or pause low-performing ones
- Redirect funds to channels with higher conversion rates
- Use UTM tracking to pinpoint successful campaign elements
- Analyze performance by location and device to target valuable segments

## Conclusion

### Steps Review

To track Revenue Per Click (RPC) effectively, you'll need a clear plan. Start by setting up first-party tracking and configuring UTM parameters to capture traffic sources accurately. Then, monitor key metrics in real time to determine which campaigns and channels deliver the best results.
