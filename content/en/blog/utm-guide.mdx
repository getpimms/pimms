Marketing campaigns thrive on precise tracking and conversion optimization. 

If you’re running campaigns to acquire leads, UTM tracking is your secret weapon. 

**PIMMS** takes it to the next level by not only shortening your URLs but also turning them into smart deep links that guide users directly to the best experience – whether on the web or within native apps.

## What is a UTM code and how it works

Think of UTM codes as additional tags added to a URL. Each tag, called a “parameter,” helps you answer:
- **What type of content resonates most with your audience**
- **Where your traffic is coming from**
- **Which campaigns deliver the highest ROI**

With this clear view of your customer journey, you can make data-driven decisions and optimize your campaigns through A/B testing. 

Not using UTMs means leaving money on the table, and misusing them could cost you even more.

### The core UTM parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                      | Example Value                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **utm_source**  | Identifies the source of the traffic                             | `facebook_ads`, `newsletter_jan`, `partner_site`  |
| **utm_medium**  | Specifies the marketing medium used                              | `ppc`, `affiliate`, `organic_social`              |
| **utm_campaign**| Represents the specific product, promotion, or campaign          | `new_year_launch`, `black_friday_special`         |
| **utm_term**    | Tracks paid keywords associated with the campaign                | `best_running_shoes`, `cheap_flight_deals`        |
| **utm_content** | Differentiates creative elements within the same campaign        | `red_banner_v1`, `blue_banner_v2`                 |

### How UTM parameters work

1. **Click tracking:** When a user clicks on a UTM-tagged link (from an ad, email, social post, or profile), the link directs them to your site while passing along the UTM parameters.
2. **Data capture:** Analytics tools capture these parameters and associate them with the user’s session.
3. **Behavior analysis:** As the user navigates your site or app, the system records their journey, showing pages visited, time spent, and actions taken.
4. **Conversion tracking:** When a desired action (purchase, sign-up) is completed, the UTM data ties that conversion back to the original campaign.

PIMMS enhances this process with deep linking: not only do you track where your traffic originates, but PIMMS smart links also ensure users land in the optimal environment – whether in a browser or a native app.

## UTM code examples with PIMMS deep linking

### Example 1: UTM-coded link for a social media campaign (LinkedIn)

Suppose you’re running a LinkedIn ad for a summer sale. A deep link via PIMMS might look like:

```bash
https://pim.ms/sale?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_content=carousel_ad_v1
```

- **utm_source:** `linkedin` – the traffic comes from LinkedIn.
- **utm_medium:** `paid_social` – indicates paid social media.
- **utm_campaign:** `summer_sale` – tracks the summer sale campaign.
- **utm_content:** `carousel_ad_v1` – distinguishes this creative version.

When clicked, this link detects the device and, if on mobile, can directly open the corresponding app (or fallback to the web).

### Example 2: UTM-coded link for an email campaign

For a product launch, your email might include:

```bash
https://pim.ms/product-launch?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=product_launch&utm_content=cta_button
```


- **utm_source:** `newsletter` – from your email campaign.
- **utm_medium:** `email` – clearly marks email as the channel.
- **utm_campaign:** `product_launch` – ties the click to the product launch.
- **utm_content:** `cta_button` – differentiates the call-to-action element.

PIMMS ensures that if a recipient clicks from a mobile device, they’re seamlessly taken to your app for a smoother conversion process.

### Example 3: UTM-coded link for YouTube content

A YouTube creator or marketer might use:

```bash
https://pim.ms/youtube?utm_source=social&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=channel_growth&utm_content=video_thumbnail
```

- **utm_source:** `social` – identifies that the traffic originates from a social share.
- **utm_medium:** `organic_social` – indicates the nature of the engagement.
- **utm_campaign:** `channel_growth` – tracks the campaign focused on growing your channel.
- **utm_content:** `video_thumbnail` – distinguishes the creative used (the video thumbnail).

For mobile users, PIMMS deep links directly open the YouTube app, enhancing viewer engagement and subscription likelihood.

## How to set up UTM parameters with PIMMS

Setting up UTM parameters with PIMMS is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Access the PIMMS UTM Builder:**  
   Visit the PIMMS platform and start by entering your destination URL.

2. **Add Your Parameters:**  
   Fill in the core fields (source, medium, campaign) and optionally include term, content, and referral tags. PIMMS also supports saving **reusable UTM templates** for consistency across campaigns.

3. **Generate Your Deep Link:**  
   PIMMS automatically converts your UTM-tagged URL into a deep link. It’s not just a short link – it’s a smart link that directs users to the best experience (app or browser).

4. **Deploy and Analyze:**  
   Use your PIMMS deep link in your marketing campaigns. Monitor performance through PIMMS’s analytics dashboard that captures detailed metrics for every click and conversion.

## UTM tracking best practices & common pitfalls

### Mistakes to avoid

1. **Not using templates:**  
   Avoid inconsistency. Use PIMMS’s template feature to ensure uniform naming conventions.
2. **Using capital letters:**  
   Remember: UTM parameters are case-sensitive. Stick to lowercase to avoid duplicate data.
3. **Tracking internal links:**  
   Reserve UTMs for external traffic only. Internal links should rely on different analytics setups.
4. **Copy-pasting links for new campaigns:**  
   Always generate unique UTM parameters for each campaign—even if the destination URL remains the same.
5. **Using long links:**  
   PIMMS not only shortens your URL but transforms it into a deep link, keeping it both short and functional.
6. **Adding unnecessary parameters:**  
   Focus on parameters that provide meaningful insights. Too many tags can clutter your data.

### Disadvantages of using UTM parameters

While invaluable for tracking, UTMs come with certain limitations:

- **Re-sharing issues:**  
  If a UTM-tagged link is shared beyond its intended audience, the original parameters remain intact, potentially skewing your data.
- **Exposure of campaign details:**  
  UTMs are visible in the URL. Competitors might gain insight into your campaign strategies if not concealed.  
  *Solution:* With PIMMS, your deep links can be managed and branded, helping protect sensitive campaign details.

## The PIMMS advantage: deep links with UTM precision
