  - **External ID:** the client's email address.
  - **Email:** client's email.
  - **Name:** client's name.

### ‚ö° Important notes

- If someone submits multiple times using the same email, only the first closed deal is counted as a conversion.
- Always make sure the `pimms_id` is correctly passed through your iClosed submission.

### Troubleshooting tips

If your Zap fails:

- Check Zapier **Task History** to view detailed errors.
- Common issues:
  - **Missing or invalid `pimms_id`**
  - **Incorrect field mapping**

In case of errors, revisit your Zapier mapping.

### 7. The best ways to share your iClosed link and track deals (A, B, or C)

#### ‚úÖ Option A: Share a PiMMs short link (recommended)

- Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io) and create a short link pointing to your iClosed form or landing page.
- Enable **conversion tracking**.
- Share your PiMMs link through emails, LinkedIn posts, QR codes, or marketing campaigns.

Example:
```
https://pim.ms/your-link
```

üí° **Why use this method?**
- It works across all channels (email, posts, ads).
- It precisely attributes each deal to the correct campaign.

---

#### ‚úÖ Option B: Share your own website (without embedding a PiMMs link directly)

If your iClosed form is embedded in your website (e.g., Webflow, Wix, Framer), **do not hardcode a PiMMs link inside your HTML**.

**Why?**
If you embed a PiMMs link directly, all visitors will appear as coming from the same source, which breaks accurate attribution.

**Instead, do this:**
- Use your standard iClosed link, and append `?pimms_id=1` to the URL:

```html
<a href="https://app.iclosed.io/e/xyz?pimms_id=1">Fill out the form</a>
```

- Then add these scripts in your website's `<head>` section:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

These scripts automatically detect the visitor's `pimms_id` and inject it into the iClosed form link.

---

#### ‚úÖ Option C: Generate dynamic links (for developers)

If you're using **Next.js**, **Nuxt**, or another modern framework:

```js
const pimmsId = getCookie("pimms_id");
const iclosedUrl = `https://app.iclosed.io/e/xyz?pimms_id=${pimmsId}`;
```

Use this URL in your buttons, redirects, or dynamic components to ensure perfect attribution.
