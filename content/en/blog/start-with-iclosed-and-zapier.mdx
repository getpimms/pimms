### âš¡ Important notes

- If someone submits multiple times using the same email, only the first closed deal is counted as a conversion.
- Always make sure the `pimms_id` is correctly passed through your iClosed submission.

### Troubleshooting tips

If your Zap fails:

- Check Zapier **Task History** to view detailed errors.
- Common issues:
  - **Missing or invalid `pimms_id`**
  - **Incorrect field mapping**

In case of errors, revisit your Zapier mapping.
