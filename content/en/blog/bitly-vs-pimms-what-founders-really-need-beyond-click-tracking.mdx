Founders looking for more than just URL shortening and click tracking have two strong options: **[Bitly](https://bitly.com/)** and **[PIMMS](https://pimms.io/)**. While Bitly provides a broad toolkit for link management and analytics, PIMMS focuses on connecting marketing efforts directly to revenue with [advanced conversion tracking](https://pimms.io/blog/start-with-zapier) and app linking. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

- **Bitly**: Offers branded links, QR codes, and data visualizations (e.g., maps, graphs) to track engagement across campaigns. Plans start at $120/year for 30 days of data retention.
- **PIMMS**: Prioritizes real-time revenue tracking, deep linking for mobile apps, and seamless integrations with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). Plans include detailed conversion insights and start at 45â‚¬ for a lifetime access.

### Quick Comparison

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

## Core Tracking Features

Letâ€™s dive into how the core tracking features of these platforms can give founders the tools they need to make smarter decisions.

Modern tracking tools donâ€™t just collect data - they provide actionable insights into user behavior and campaign results, helping businesses refine their strategies.

### Click Data: Location and Device Stats

Bitlyâ€™s analytics dashboard offers a clear look at how links, QR codes, and landing pages are performing. It breaks down total engagements, timing trends, geographic reach, and referral sources - all in one place [\[1\]](https://support.bitly.com/hc/en-us/articles/20370474672141-What-metrics-are-available-in-Bitly).

On the other hand, PIMMS zeroes in on conversions, connecting marketing efforts directly to revenue. Its advanced filters allow founders to segment data in ways that matter most:

- **Traffic Sources**: UTM parameters, referrers
- **User Context**: Device type, location
- **Campaign Data**: Campaign names, performance metrics
- **Revenue Impact**: Conversion events, sales data

This level of tracking can make a real difference - studies show that branded short links alone can boost click-through rates by up to 35% [\[5\]](https://sourceforge.net/software/product/PIMMS).

### Data Storage and Export

Real-time insights are great, but the ability to store and export historical data takes planning to the next level.

Bitly uses a tiered data retention system, while PIMMS integrates effortlessly with tools like Stripe, Shopify, and Zapier to streamline workflows [\[2\]](https://slashdot.org/software/p/PIMMS).

| Plan Level | Data History | Annual Cost |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Core       | 30 days      | $120        |
| Growth     | 4 months     | $348        |
| Premium    | 1 year       | $2,388      |
| Enterprise | 2 years      | Custom      |

For growing businesses, having access to historical data is essential. However, longer retention periods often come with higher-tier plans, making it a key factor to consider when choosing a platform.

## Sales and Revenue Tracking

Clicks are just the tip of the iceberg. For founders, the real challenge is linking marketing efforts directly to revenue.

### Cross-Channel Attribution

Understanding which channels drive sales is essential for fine-tuning ad budgets and campaign strategies. A great example comes from Bitly's analytics dashboard: one international e-commerce business saw a **34% boost in click-through rates** and a **22% increase in conversion rates** within six months of using custom branded links [\[8\]](https://vizologi.com/business-strategy-canvas/bitly-business-model-canvas).

PIMMS takes this a step further by tracking marketing touchpoints across devices, giving a clearer picture of how customers interact with campaigns. This is especially important when you consider that **email marketing delivers $36 for every $1 spent** [\[3\]](https://bitly.com/blog/click-tracking).

With advanced filtering capabilities, PIMMS helps businesses uncover:

- The traffic sources that bring in the most valuable customers
- The role each marketing channel plays in driving conversions
- Points in the sales funnel where customers drop off
- Which content contributes the most to revenue

These insights feed directly into sales data integration, offering a more precise look at marketingâ€™s impact on the bottom line.

### Sales Data Integration

PIMMS connects seamlessly with popular e-commerce and payment platforms, bridging the gap between marketing activities and revenue generation.

| **Integration Feature** | **Revenue Tracking Benefits**                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Stripe Connection       | Real-time sales and lifetime value tracking    |
| Shopify Integration     | Automatic order attribution to campaigns       |
| UTM Parameter Support   | Detailed performance measurement for campaigns |
| Custom Event Tracking   | Monitoring specific conversion points          |

By mapping the entire customer journey, PIMMS enables businesses to attribute revenue accurately, calculate campaign ROI, pinpoint profitable acquisition channels, and allocate marketing budgets more effectively [\[6\]](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/CampaignTrackly-vs-PIMMS).

The impact of strong integration tools is undeniable - enterprise users have reported a staggering **3,800% year-over-year growth** in multi-product adoption across their customer base [\[7\]](https://bitly.com/pages/resources/press/bitly-wraps-2022-surpassing-100m-in-arr-and-over-500k-global-customers). Thatâ€™s the power of aligning marketing and revenue data in one place.

## Mobile App Linking

In todayâ€™s mobile-driven world, smooth transitions between web and mobile apps play a huge role in keeping users engaged. Yet, **51% of mobile deep link opportunities are missed** [\[11\]](https://bitly.com/blog/mobile-deep-linking), making it clear why reliable deep linking solutions are so crucial.

### App Opening and Web Backup

PIMMS leverages deep linking to ensure users are directed to the best possible destination. When someone clicks on a PIMMS link, the system identifies the device and uses platform-specific routing to create a seamless journey.

Hereâ€™s how PIMMS handles different scenarios:

| Scenario          | PIMMS Action                                                            | User Benefit                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| App Installed     | Opens the app directly using Universal Links (iOS) or Android App Links | Instant access to specific content    |
| App Not Installed | Redirects to the app store and deep links after installation            | Smooth onboarding experience          |
| Store Decline     | Falls back to the mobile web version                                    | No dead ends, keeps the journey going |
| Desktop Access    | Provides a browser-optimized experience                                 | Consistency across all devices        |

To avoid common issues, PIMMS automatically loads a fallback webpage if an app redirect isnâ€™t successful [\[10\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/use-cases/customer-experience-deep-linking/universal-linking-challenges-ios-10-3). Beyond routing, it also ensures user settings are retained, delivering a consistent experience no matter how users interact with the platform.

### User Platform Settings

PIMMS focuses on the user by maintaining platform preferences across sessions. Hereâ€™s what it offers:

- **Automatic device detection** that remembers user preferences for each platform.
- **Customizable domain-level settings** for precise control.
- **Real-time analytics** to track app interactions and store visits.

As Bitly Support explains, "Mobile deep links are a way to seamlessly route mobile users to the best place to view your content, whether it's on your website or your mobile app" [\[9\]](https://support.bitly.com/hc/en-us/articles/231262448-What-are-mobile-deep-links). This approach ensures users always get where they need to go, without frustration or unnecessary steps.

## Tool Integration and Automation

For founders, having marketing tools that seamlessly connect with analytics platforms isn't just a preference - it's a necessity. In 2023, a striking 87% of Forbes Cloud 100 companies relied on Zapier for automation, underscoring the growing demand for smooth integration to scale operations efficiently [\[12\]](https://zapier.com/apps/bitly/integrations/shopify).

### Built-in Tools and API Options

Hereâ€™s a closer look at how these integrations make a difference:

| Platform | Integration Type   | Business Impact                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
