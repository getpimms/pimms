Marketing is tough — especially when you're left guessing what’s working and what’s not.

You're publishing LinkedIn posts, sending emails, testing landing pages, collaborating with partners, and sharing QR codes. But…

> Can you confidently say which campaign generated that meeting, signup, or sale?

**PiMMs Conversion Tracking** gives you a complete picture.

Built for startups, solopreneurs, marketers, and devs, PiMMs turns every click into an insight. Know precisely which links, posts, or campaigns are driving actual business outcomes — in real-time.

## 🎯 Move from guesswork to clarity

Most analytics tools track page views or clicks.
But what you really want to know is: _who converted?_

With PiMMs, you can connect every click to:

- Demo or meeting bookings (Cal.com, Lemcal, etc.)
- Closed deals (iClosed)
- Stripe payments
- Form submissions (Tally.so, custom)

Ask (and answer):

- **Which LinkedIn posts led to booked demos?**
- **Which email or QR code actually drove that sale?**
- **Which influencer or WhatsApp message converted the most leads?**

With PiMMs, these answers are automatic — no guesswork, no spreadsheets.

- **Works with any channel**: LinkedIn, email, WhatsApp, Webflow, etc.
- **Developer-friendly + no-code**
- **Automatic tracking with smart links**
- **Custom conversion types**: demos, signups, payments, leads...

## ⚙️ How PiMMs conversion tracking works

Each PiMMs short link carries a `pimms_id`. This ID is passed invisibly from click → to form → to Zapier or server.

You only need two events:
- **Click**: A visitor clicks a tracked PiMMs link.
- **Conversion**: You report the conversion to PiMMs — either via Zapier or your backend.

## 🔌 Integration options

### Website tracking (zero code)

Paste this into your site’s `<head>`:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

:::info
**Check if it's working (Optional)**

Open your website and type `window._pimmsAnalytics` in the browser console.  
If everything is installed correctly, you should see some values.
:::

Add `?pimms_id=1` (or `?pimms_client_reference_id=1` for Stripe) to your internal links where a PiMMs redirect isn’t possible. This ensures the correct tracking ID is passed even when users aren’t clicking a PiMMs short link.

**Examples:**

**Cal.com — Meeting links (lead tracking):**
```html
<a href="https://cal.com/your-name/meeting?pimms_id=1">Book now</a>
```

**iClosed — Form or lead funnel:**
```html
<a href="https://app.iclosed.io/e/xyz?pimms_id=1">Submit deal</a>
```

**Stripe — Payment link (sales tracking):**
```html
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?pimms_client_reference_id=1">Buy now</a>
```

💡 PiMMs will automatically inject the actual `pimms_id` or `client_reference_id` dynamically based on the visitor’s origin — ensuring proper attribution.

### React (client-side)

```jsx
import { Analytics as PimmsAnalytics } from "@getpimms/analytics";

<PimmsAnalytics
  cookieOptions={{ domain: ".yourdomain.com" }}
/>
```

### Backend (server-side) conversion

```ts
import { Pimms } from "pimms";

const pimms = new Pimms({ token: "YOUR_TOKEN" });

await pimms.track.lead({
  eventName: "Signup",
  externalId: "user_123",
  customerEmail: "jane@example.com",
  customerName: "Jane Doe",
  metadata: {
    campaign: "Launch Week",
    source: "LinkedIn Post",
  },
});

res.clearCookie("pimms_id");
```

Or use Zapier with tools like **Cal.com**, **Tally.so**, or **iClosed** to send conversions instantly.
