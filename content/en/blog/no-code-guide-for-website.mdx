In just a few minutes, you'll learn how to install tracking on your site using no-code or AI.

You'll be able to track every appointment, submitted form or Stripe payment, even if you're using Webflow, Framer, Bold.new, Lovable.dev... or any other platform or site.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll cover together:

- How to install tracking on your site
- How to create links that track your leads and sales
- How to avoid tracking errors and wrong attribution

Ready? Let's go.

## Why you shouldn't put shortened links directly on your site

If you put a pim.ms/abc short link directly on your site (in a button or form), all visitors will seem to come from the same source (the same short link).

Result: attribution is wrong.

The right method: use your original URLs with a simple parameter. I'll explain how in detail below.

## Step 1: Add the tracking scripts to your site

Add these two scripts to your site:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

âœ… Works for all sites, including:

- Webflow
- Wix
- Framer
- Squarespace
- Bold.new
- Lovable.dev
- Bubble
- Carrd
- etc.

Once added, PiMMs handles everything.

## Step 2: Create your links with the right parameters

Depending on your goal, here's how to create your links:

### Appointments (Cal.com, Calendly, Lemcal)

You need to add the `pimms_id=1` parameter at the end of your link:

```html
https://cal.com/your-name/meeting?pimms_id=1
```

### Forms or deals (Tally, iClosed, Typeform, Notion)

You need to add the `pimms_id=1` parameter at the end of your link:

```html
https://app.iclosed.io/e/xyz?pimms_id=1
```

### Stripe payments

For Stripe, add `pimms_client_reference_id=1` at the end of your link:

```html
https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?pimms_client_reference_id=1
```

## Ideal no-code configuration examples

- **Framer**: Add a Calendly or Lemcal link with `?pimms_id=1`
- **Webflow**: Add `?pimms_client_reference_id=1` to your Stripe links in buttons
- **Bold.new**: Ask the AI to add PiMMs scripts in the custom code section
- **Lovable.dev**: Simply use `?pimms_id=1` in your links â€” the platform automatically applies the logic
