Using Cal.com to schedule calls on your site?

With PiMMs, you can finally track where each booking comes from â€” no dev skills needed.

Hereâ€™s how to enable tracking depending on how youâ€™ve embedded Cal.com:

---

## Add this base script

Place this script on any page where you want to track visitors:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

---

## Case 1: Embedded calendar using `data-cal-link`

If you're embedding Cal.com as a button, just add `?pimms_id=1` at the end of your link. Example:

```html
<button data-cal-link="alexandre/30min?pimms_id=1">Book now</button>
```

Thatâ€™s it. PiMMs will automatically replace `1` with the real visitor ID.

---

## Case 2: Inline calendar (embedded with JavaScript)

If you're embedding Cal inline inside your page, follow these two steps:

1. Add this script before loading Cal.com:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.expose.js"></script>
```

2. Add `?pimms_id=${window.pimms_id}` to your calendar link:

```js
Cal.ns["30min"]("inline", {
  elementOrSelector: "...",
  calLink: `alexandre/30min?pimms_id=${window.pimms_id}`
});
```

Done. PiMMs will track each visitor automatically.

---

## Case 3: Simple link (non-embed)

If youâ€™re using a basic Cal.com link in your page:

```html
<a href="https://cal.com/alexandre/30min?pimms_id=1">Book now</a>
```

Add `?pimms_id=1` to the end. PiMMs will update it at click time.

---

Your calendar is now fully trackable.

Works with any no-code platform.
