### Building Your First UTM Scenario

Setting up UTM tracking in Make ensures your marketing campaigns are accurately attributed. With this setup, you can automatically create and attach UTM parameters to your social media links.

For instance, back on January 15, 2021, certified Make Partner Andy O'Neil showcased how to generate Google tracking URLs for marketing campaigns using a Slack integration [\[2\]](https://www.make.com/en/use-cases/slack-utm-link-generator). Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

- **Initial Setup**  
  Start by creating a new scenario in Make. Select a trigger module that fits your workflow - this could be Slack, Google Sheets, or even a scheduled trigger.
- **Parameter Configuration**  
  Define the UTM parameters to suit your campaign needs. Here’s a quick reference table:

  | Parameter    | Format                    | Example            |
  | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
  | utm_source   | Platform name (lowercase) | facebook, linkedin |
  | utm_medium   | Traffic type              | cpc, social, email |
  | utm_campaign | Campaign identifier       | spring_sale_2025   |
  | utm_content  | Ad variation              | carousel_ad_1      |
  | utm_term     | Keywords/targeting        | us_audience        |

- **URL Generation**  
  Use Make's URL builder module to combine your base URL with the UTM parameters. Ensure proper encoding to avoid issues with tracking.

After setting up your initial scenario, you can refine your UTM settings to align with the specific requirements of each social media platform.

### UTM Parameters by Social Platform

Once your scenario is ready, customize your UTM parameters based on the platform you’re targeting:

- **Meta (Facebook & Instagram):** Use Ads Manager to input dynamic parameters like `{{campaign.name}}` for automated tracking.
- **LinkedIn:** Manually paste the UTM-tagged URL into the "Destination URL" field, as LinkedIn doesn’t support dynamic parameters.
- **TikTok:** For campaigns running in Custom Mode, configure UTM parameters in the "Ad Details" section under "Destination Page." Be mindful of proper formatting here [\[3\]](https://wolfenden.agency/insights/how-to-add-utm-parameters-to-most-social-media-platforms).

### Data Quality and Platform Rules

To maintain accurate tracking, follow these best practices:

| Best Practice    | Implementation                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Case Sensitivity | Always use lowercase for all parameters |
| Spacing          | Replace spaces with dashes (-)          |
| URL Structure    | Encode special characters properly      |

You can also use automated validation to ensure parameter formatting, URL integrity, and naming conventions are consistent. This step is crucial for meeting platform compliance standards.

For cross-platform campaigns, Make’s error-handling tools are a lifesaver. Set up notifications to alert you of URL generation failures and use automatic retry mechanisms to keep your tracking intact. These measures help prevent disruptions and ensure smooth campaign performance.

## UTM Tracking Management

### UTM Naming Standards

Using consistent UTM naming conventions in Make is key to maintaining accurate and reliable data.

| **Parameter** | **Convention**                     | **Example**                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Source        | Use the platform name in lowercase | facebook, linkedin, twitter      |
| Medium        | Define the traffic type            | social, cpc, email               |
| Campaign      | Identify the campaign              | spring_sale_2025, product_launch |
| Content       | Specify creative variations        | video_ad_1, carousel_post        |

Keep all UTM parameters documented in a master spreadsheet. This centralized guide ensures uniformity across campaigns and makes reporting in PIMMS more straightforward. For recurring campaigns, Make's automation tools can help you keep everything up to date effortlessly.

### Recurring Campaign Updates

Make offers automation features to streamline UTM parameter updates for ongoing social media campaigns. This saves time and ensures your tracking remains consistent.

For example, [Meta Ads](https://business.meta.com/?locale=en_US) introduced an update in April 2025 [\[5\]](https://web.swipeinsight.app/posts/meta-ads-now-automatically-include-utm-parameters-for-all-ads-15967), automatically adding UTM parameters to all ads. However, when managing campaigns across multiple platforms, Make can help standardize UTM tracking. Here’s how:

1\. **Parameter Template Creation**

Build templates in Make to auto-generate UTM parameters based on your campaign structure. These templates can include variables like:

- Campaign season or quarter
- Platform-specific identifiers
- Content variations for tracking

2\. **Dynamic Value Updates**

Set up Make scenarios to update UTM parameters automatically when:

- New creatives are rolled out
- Additional social platforms are integrated
- Seasonal campaigns or promotions kick off

This ensures seamless data integration with PIMMS.

3\. **Validation Checks**

Leverage the Google Analytics Campaign URL builder module in Make to validate UTM formatting and enforce consistent case usage.

### Common UTM Setup Issues

Even with a solid process, technical hiccups can occur. Here are some common issues and how to address them:

| **Issue**             | **Impact**                      | **Solution**                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Case Sensitivity      | Causes tracking inconsistencies | Standardize parameters to lowercase [\[6\]](https://impact.com/commerce-content/6-mistakes-publishers-make-with-utm-tracking)         |
| Parameter Duplication | Leads to incorrect attribution  | Remove duplicate UTM entries in Make [\[7\]](https://www.optimizesmart.com/ga4-utm-parameters-not-working-here-is-how-to-fix-it)      |
| Internal Link Tagging | Skews data accuracy             | Exclude internal URLs from UTM automation [\[7\]](https://www.optimizesmart.com/ga4-utm-parameters-not-working-here-is-how-to-fix-it) |

A notable example from the Make Community [\[8\]](https://community.make.com/t/issue-with-correctly-mapping-city-state-and-country-fields-in-crm-via-utm-parameters/77814) highlights errors in UTM mapping for Facebook and Google due to improper CRM field mapping.

To avoid these pitfalls, apply these safeguards in your Make workflows:

- Use the Google Analytics Campaign URL builder module to confirm parameter accuracy.
- Configure error-handling for malformed UTM strings.
- Test new UTM setups with automated workflows before rolling them out.

These practices will help you ensure your UTM tracking is both accurate and efficient.
