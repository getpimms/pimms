## 2. Add `pimms_id` to every funnel link

To preserve tracking through your funnel, make sure every custom **button** or **link** that moves a visitor to the next step includes this parameter:

```
?pimms_id=1
```

To update your links:

1. Go to the funnel step.  
2. Click **Edit Page**.  
3. Select the button or link.  
4. Append `?pimms_id=1` at the end of the destination URL.  

**Example:**

```
https://xyz.systeme.io/abc?pimms_id=1
```

‚úÖ PiMMs will automatically carry the tracking forward ‚Äî as long as the `pimms_id` is present on your links.

## 3. Find your Workspace ID

1. Go to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io/).  
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Workspace ID**.  
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`).

## 4. Set up your Systeme.io webhook

To send lead and sale events to PiMMs:

1. In Systeme.io, go to **Settings** from the avatar menu.  
2. Scroll down to **Webhooks** and click **Create**.  
3. Name your webhook (e.g. `PiMMs Webhook`).  
4. Fill in the Webhook URL:

```
https://app.pimms.io/api/systemeio/webhook?workspace_id=your-id
```

üëâ Replace `your-id` with your **Workspace ID without the `ws_` prefix**.

5. Use the same value for the **Webhook Secret**.

**Example:**

- Workspace ID: `ws_cm74uxwy50000xuid9p4zdy5d`  
- URL: `https://app.pimms.io/api/systemeio/webhook?workspace_id=cm74uxwy50000xuid9p4zdy5d`  
- Secret: `cm74uxwy50000xuid9p4zdy5d`  

6. Select these events:  
- ‚úÖ `Opt-in`  
- ‚úÖ `New sale`  

7. Click **Save**.

## 5. Create your PiMMs tracking link

Before testing your funnel, you need to create a PiMMs short link to ensure conversion tracking is enabled:

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io).  
2. Create a **new short link** pointing to the **first step** of your Systeme.io funnel.  
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**.

**Example:**

```
https://pim.ms/my-sales-funnel
```

Share this link everywhere ‚Äî ads, email, social ‚Äî and all conversions will be tracked automatically.

2. Click through the opt-in and sale steps.

If you don‚Äôt see your leads or sales in PiMMs:

- Double-check that **`?pimms_id=1`** is present on all links in your funnel.

- Ensure the **workspace ID** is correct and used both in the webhook URL and the secret.  
- You can test again in **incognito** using a new email address.

- If you‚Äôre using automations or custom domains, make sure the full link keeps the `pimms_id`.
