**Branded short links can boost click-through rates by up to 39% compared to generic links.** Why? They build trust, improve transparency, and reinforce brand recognition - all of which make users more likely to click.

Here’s what you need to know:

- **Branded links** include your company name or keywords (e.g., `yourbrand.co/sale`), making them more trustworthy and professional.
- **Generic links** use third-party domains like `bit.ly/abc123`, which can appear less reliable and miss branding opportunities.
- **Trust matters:** Users are cautious about clicking unclear or random links. Branded links remove hesitation by showing exactly where the link leads.

### Quick Comparison

| **Factor**             | **Branded Links**                | **Generic Links**        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Trust**              | High – users recognize the brand | Low – potential distrust |
| **Click-Through Rate** | Up to 39% higher                 | Lower                    |
| **Brand Recognition**  | Strong – supports branding       | None                     |
| **Setup**              | Requires custom domain           | Quick and easy           |
| **Analytics**          | Detailed tracking available      | Basic or limited         |

If you want to build credibility, track performance, and improve conversions, **branded links are the better choice.** Generic links are fine for casual use, but they lack the trust and branding power needed for impactful campaigns.

## What Are Branded and Generic Short Links

Both branded and generic short links serve the same basic purpose: they condense long URLs into shorter, more manageable ones. However, the key difference lies in the domain they use. Branded links incorporate a custom domain that reflects your identity, while generic links rely on third-party domains. This choice can significantly impact user trust and, in turn, conversion rates. Let’s break down how each type works and how they shape user perception.

### Branded Short Links Explained

Branded short links turn your domain into a part of your marketing strategy. For example, instead of a random URL, you might use something like _yourbrand.link/campaign_ or _company.co/sale_. These links not only look professional but also build trust by clearly showing where the link will lead.

Many well-known companies have embraced this approach to strengthen their branding. For example:

- **[Saint Gobain](https://www.saint-gobain.com/en)** uses branded short links to share portfolios, product catalogs, and corporate documents, reinforcing its professional image and reliability [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns).
- **[Monday.com](https://monday.com/)** incorporates branded links into its social media campaigns, enhancing its identity and making its promotions more relevant [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns).
- **[Samsonite](https://shop.samsonite.com/)** relies on custom short URLs to track consumer behavior, refine retail strategies, and evaluate the success of product promotions [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns).

By using a custom domain and tailoring the link’s path, branded links give you complete control over how your links appear. Each link becomes a small but powerful advertisement for your brand.

### Generic Short Links Explained

Generic short links, on the other hand, use domains provided by third-party services such as _[bit.ly](https://bitly.com/)_ or _[tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/)_. These links look something like _bit.ly/3xK9mP2_. They’re a practical choice for casual or short-term use, where branding isn’t a priority.

For small businesses or individuals, generic links are an affordable option. However, they come with trade-offs. Since they don’t reflect your brand, they may not inspire the same level of trust. Additionally, while these services usually offer basic analytics like click counts, they lack the deeper insights that branded links can provide.

The choice between branded and generic links ultimately depends on your goals. If you’re sharing something informal or temporary, generic links can do the job. But if you’re focused on building trust, strengthening your brand, or running impactful marketing campaigns, branded links are the way to go.

## How Branded and Generic Links Affect Conversion Rates

The distinction between branded and generic short links isn’t just cosmetic - it directly impacts how many people engage with your links and take action. Whether you're running marketing campaigns or sharing content, these click-through rates can be the deciding factor in achieving your conversion goals.

### Branded Links Get More Clicks

Studies show that branded links can increase click-through rates by 34–40% compared to generic links [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns)[\[5\]](https://www.rebrandly.com/blog/best-domain-branded-links)[\[6\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-branded-short-links-michael-grover-tnmjc). Why? It comes down to user psychology. People naturally gravitate toward links that feel familiar and reliable. When a URL includes a recognizable brand name, it creates an instant sense of connection and trust that generic links simply can’t replicate. This trust factor plays a huge role in the performance edge branded links have.

### Trust and Transparency Matter

Trust is a critical factor in whether someone clicks on a link or keeps scrolling. Branded links establish that trust by clearly signaling where the link will lead. For instance, seeing a URL like _brandname.com/special-offer_ immediately reassures users about its destination. On the other hand, generic short links, such as _short.ly/abc123_, often leave users guessing, which can make them hesitant to click.

In today’s online environment, where security concerns are top of mind, transparency is more important than ever. Generic links, which obscure their destination, may even be deprioritized by certain social media platforms because they can appear spammy [\[6\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-branded-short-links-michael-grover-tnmjc).

The difference in trust can directly impact performance. For example, a Facebook ad using a branded link achieved double the click-through rate (CTR) of a generic link when the preview image was removed [\[4\]](https://www.branch.io/resources/blog/do-branded-links-matter). This demonstrates how branded links can outperform their generic counterparts, even in less visually appealing scenarios.

### How Users View Different Link Types

The way users perceive a link significantly influences their behavior. Links featuring a known brand name trigger instant recognition, making the decision to click almost automatic [\[1\]](https://medium.com/@hassan.khattak/branded-links-vs-generic-links-whats-better-for-your-marketing-strategy-17abd3e71675). Even if users don’t click right away, they’re still exposed to your brand, which helps build familiarity over time. Generic links, however, miss this branding opportunity entirely.

Here’s a quick comparison of the two link types:

| Feature                | Branded Short Links | Generic Short Links |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Trust**              | Higher              | Lower               |
| **Brand Recognition**  | Increased           | None                |
| **Click-Through Rate** | Higher              | Lower               |
| **Transparency**       | High                | Low                 |

Transparency doesn’t just drive clicks - it also builds long-term goodwill. A study found that 73% of consumers are willing to spend more on products from brands that prioritize transparency [\[7\]](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-media-transparency). While this statistic applies to products, the principle extends to all brand interactions, including the links you share. Additionally, 53% of consumers are more likely to consider brands that demonstrate transparency on social media for future purchases [\[7\]](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-media-transparency). By consistently using branded links, you align with these expectations and reinforce the trust modern audiences value.

## How to Set Up and Use Branded Links

Now that you know how branded links can boost your marketing efforts, let’s go over how to implement them effectively. This process involves three main steps: setting up your branded domain, incorporating it into your campaigns, and analyzing its performance.

### Creating Your Branded Links

The first step is choosing a custom domain that reflects your brand. This could be your company name, a relevant keyword, or a shortened version of your brand name. For instance, if your company is "Marketing Solutions", you could go with something like "mktgsolutions.co" or "msolutions.link."

Next, register your chosen domain through a link management platform that supports branded links. Once registered, connect the domain to the platform to start creating your links.

When creating your short links, customize the back-half of the URL with keywords or campaign-specific terms. For example, instead of a generic string like "abc123", you can create something more meaningful, like "yourbrand.co/summer-sale" or "yourbrand.co/newsletter-signup."

Consistency is crucial. Using the same branded domain across all marketing channels strengthens brand recognition and builds trust with your audience. Once your branded links are ready, you’re set to deploy them strategically.

### Using Branded Links in Your Marketing

Branded links can make a big impact when used thoughtfully across your marketing channels. On social media, they stand out in crowded feeds and instantly convey your brand. Seeing your branded domain repeatedly helps audiences recognize and remember your business.

Email marketing is another area where branded links shine. Unlike generic short URLs, branded links maintain a professional appearance and align with your brand identity, all while being less likely to trigger spam filters.

In SMS marketing, branded links can make your calls-to-action clearer and more engaging. For example, nonprofits often use branded links in SMS donation campaigns to boost response rates and track results effectively [\[8\]](https://geotargetly.com/blog/url-shortening).

Using the same branded domain across emails, social posts, and text messages creates a consistent brand experience. This cohesive approach can increase revenue by up to 23% [\[9\]](https://odys.global/resources/what-is-a-branded-short-domain).

You can also combine branded links with QR codes on physical marketing materials. This strategy connects your offline campaigns to your digital efforts, making it easier to track how offline promotions drive online engagement. Once your links are live, be sure to monitor their performance and adjust your strategy as needed.

### Tracking Performance With Analytics

Branded links not only improve click-through rates but also provide valuable data. Use analytics tools and UTM parameters to track how your links perform. Consistent UTM naming conventions are essential for keeping your data clear and actionable.

Platforms like [PIMMS](https://pimms.io/) offer robust analytics for branded links, allowing you to track clicks, conversions, and sales. You can filter data by traffic source, device type, location, and campaign, giving you detailed insights into what’s working.

A/B testing is another powerful tool. Experiment with different back-half customizations, placements, or calls-to-action to see what resonates most with your audience. This data-driven approach helps fine-tune your strategy.

Keep an eye on key metrics like click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and revenue attribution. Integrating branded link tracking with tools like [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) or your CRM provides a more complete view of your performance. And since many users interact with links on mobile devices, make sure your branded links lead to mobile-friendly pages and test them across different devices and browsers for a seamless user experience.

## Branded vs Generic Links: Side-by-Side Comparison

Understanding the key differences between branded and generic links can help you determine which option aligns better with your marketing goals. A study by Affinity Revolution revealed: _"We found that the post with the branded link obtained a higher click-through rate than its counterpart containing a generic short URL"_ [\[3\]](https://support.rebrandly.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007615288-Generic-Short-URLs-vs-Branded-Links-Which-Has-Better-CTR). This finding underscores the practical advantages of branded links and highlights the trade-offs involved.

This table clearly illustrates how branded links outperform generic ones in areas like trust, click-through rates, and brand recognition.

With a _39% higher click-through rate_ [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns)[\[3\]](https://support.rebrandly.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007615288-Generic-Short-URLs-vs-Branded-Links-Which-Has-Better-CTR), they offer a strong case for marketers looking to boost engagement and build trust. While generic links are easier to implement, branded links deliver a clear performance advantage for those aiming to strengthen their brand and improve campaign results.

## Conclusion: Which Link Type Should You Choose

Data reveals that branded links outperform generic ones when it comes to trust and conversions. In fact, they can boost click-through rates by as much as 39% compared to their generic counterparts [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns).

Your choice should align with your business goals and available resources. If building a strong brand identity and earning audience trust are priorities, branded links are the way to go. Many well-known companies have successfully used branded short links to enhance their reputation and track the success of their campaigns [\[2\]](https://www.linkdrip.com/blog/branded-short-links-enhancing-trust-and-recognition-in-digital-campaigns).

When making this decision, consider your specific needs. Businesses focused on branding often gain from the credibility and detailed metrics that branded links offer.
