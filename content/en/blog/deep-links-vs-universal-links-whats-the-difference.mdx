**Deep Links and Universal Links help users navigate directly to app content, but they work differently.**

- **Deep Links**: Use custom URI schemes (e.g., `myapp://page`) to open app content. They’re simple to set up but only work if the app is already installed. Without the app, users may see errors.
- **Universal Links**: Use HTTPS URLs and work on iOS. If the app is installed, the link opens it; if not, it redirects to the website. They offer better fallback options and higher security but require more setup, including domain verification.

### Quick Comparison

| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Platform Support**  | iOS, Android         | iOS only                      |
| **URL Structure**     | Custom URI schemes   | Standard HTTPS URLs           |
| **Fallback Behavior** | No built-in fallback | Redirects to website          |
| **Setup Complexity**  | Simple               | Requires domain setup         |
| **Security**          | Basic                | Higher with domain validation |

**Bottom Line**: Use Deep Links for cross-platform campaigns and Universal Links for iOS-specific, secure experiences.

## Deep Links and Universal Links Basics

### Deep Links Explained

Deep links use custom URI schemes to take users directly to specific content within an app. For example, a deep link like `myapp://section/content` might open a particular product page or feature within the app. These links are often used in email campaigns or other marketing efforts to streamline the user experience.

However, there's a catch: deep links only work if the app is already installed on the user's device. If the app isn't installed, clicking the link results in an error, leaving users unable to access the intended content.

### Universal Links Explained

Apple introduced Universal Links in 2015 [\[3\]](https://adapty.io/blog/ios-universal-links), offering a more flexible and secure way to link directly to app content for iOS users. Unlike deep links, Universal Links use standard HTTPS URLs, making them more versatile.

> "Simply put, universal links are Apple's way of linking to a page within an app. Of course, in practice there are some nuances to how this works." - Alix Carman, Content Writer, Adjust [\[2\]](https://www.adjust.com/blog/universal-links-vs-deep-links)

When a user taps a Universal Link, the system checks if the app is installed. If it is, the link opens the specific in-app content. If not, the user is seamlessly redirected to the corresponding webpage. This dual functionality ensures smoother navigation.

Universal Links are also highly secure. Apple requires an Apple App Site Association (AASA) file to verify the connection between the app and its website [\[3\]](https://adapty.io/blog/ios-universal-links). This process prevents malicious apps from hijacking legitimate links.

A few limitations exist: Universal Links only work when clicked from a webpage or email, not when manually entered into a browser [\[1\]](https://medium.com/by-all-measures/making-sense-of-universal-links-and-app-links-f59af59e22e4?source=read_next_recirc---------0---------------------a7ded20f_9d9a_48fa_b372_01d873d454d0-------). Additionally, they can't be wrapped within other URLs, as that would trigger the fallback to the web version instead of the app [\[1\]](https://medium.com/by-all-measures/making-sense-of-universal-links-and-app-links-f59af59e22e4?source=read_next_recirc---------0---------------------a7ded20f_9d9a_48fa_b372_01d873d454d0-------).

For businesses, Universal Links are a great tool to enhance user engagement and retention. They provide a seamless transition between web and app experiences while maintaining strong security measures.

Next, we'll explore the technical differences in how these links are implemented and supported across various platforms.

## Technical Differences

The way deep links and universal links are set up, supported across platforms, and handle fallback options varies quite a bit. Let’s break it down.

### Setup Requirements

Setting up deep links is straightforward. Developers create a custom URL scheme (like `myapp://products/123`) and configure handlers in the app to process these links. It’s a simple process with minimal setup.

Universal Links, on the other hand, involve more steps:

- Use standard HTTPS URLs.
- Host an **apple-app-site-association (AASA)** file on a secure HTTPS server.
- Configure the app to associate with the domain.
- Complete Apple’s domain verification process.

Here’s a quick comparison of the setup requirements:

| Requirement          | Deep Links                        | Universal Links                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| URL Format           | Custom schemes (e.g., `myapp://`) | Standard HTTPS URLs             |
| Server Configuration | None                              | AASA file on HTTPS server       |
| App Configuration    | URL scheme registration           | Domain association setup        |
| Verification Process | None                              | Apple domain verification       |
| Security Level       | Basic                             | Enhanced with domain validation |

With that covered, let’s look at how these links function across different platforms.

### Platform Support

Deep links are compatible with all major platforms, but they lack advanced fallback features. In contrast, Universal Links, introduced with iOS 9, are designed specifically for Apple devices. For Android, the equivalent is App Links, which also use HTTPS and require an `assetlinks.json` file.

### Backup Options

Universal Links shine when it comes to fallback mechanisms:

- They automatically check if the app is installed.
- If the app isn’t installed, they redirect users to the corresponding web content.
- This ensures a smooth and consistent user experience, whether the app is installed or not.

Deep links, however, don’t handle fallbacks as well:

- If the app isn’t installed, users may encounter error messages.
- Without custom fallback solutions, they can lead to broken experiences.

According to [Axon Software](https://axonsoftware.com/)’s data (September 2023 to June 2024), businesses using Universal Links saw better user retention and higher customer satisfaction compared to those relying on traditional deep links [\[4\]](https://www.axon.dev/blog/how-to-set-up-universal-links-for-ios-and-android). This is largely due to the improved fallback functionality and added security of Universal Links, making them a more reliable option for marketers aiming to enhance both performance and user engagement.

These technical differences play a key role in determining which link type is best suited for your goals.

## When to Use Each Link Type

### Deep Links: Primary Applications

Deep links are highly effective for campaigns spanning multiple platforms. Here are some key ways they're used:

**Direct Marketing Campaigns:**  
Companies like [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) use deep links in abandoned cart emails to guide users back to their incomplete purchases, helping to increase conversions.

**Cross-Platform Campaigns:**  
Deep links work seamlessly across iOS and Android. For example, [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) uses them in Facebook ads to send new users to a pre-filled page for precious metal stocks, improving engagement.

**Content Navigation:**  
Apps such as [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/) use deep links to connect web-based articles to their in-app versions, ensuring smooth transitions for users.

### Universal Links: Primary Applications

Universal Links are ideal for iOS campaigns where smooth user experiences and added security are critical:

**iOS-Centric Campaigns:**  
These links automatically check if the app is installed and then route Apple users accordingly.

**High-Security Needs:**  
Apps in sensitive sectors like finance or healthcare benefit from the added security of domain validation, which helps prevent fraudulent redirects.

**Web-to-App Transitions:**  
Universal Links create a seamless connection between web and app experiences. If the app is installed, users are taken directly there; otherwise, they are directed to a fallback web page.

These specific use cases also shape how these links should be implemented.

### Tips for Setting Up Links

Proper setup is key to making these links work effectively. Here’s how to get started:

- **Testing Across Scenarios**  
  Test your links in various messaging channels (email, SMS, social media). Ensure they behave correctly for both users with and without the app installed. Also, verify functionality across different operating system versions.
- **Integrating Analytics**  
  Add UTM parameters for campaign tracking. Use Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs) to monitor conversions and analyze key metrics like click-through rates.
- **Fallback Planning**  
  Create web fallback pages to ensure a smooth user experience, whether or not the app is installed.
