Tools like Kajabi or Klaviyo now offer revenue tracking — but with PIMMS, you can track not just emails, but also LinkedIn posts, social media, websites, SMS, and more — all from a single platform, without switching tools.

## Required Tools and Setup

To track email campaign revenue effectively, you'll need the right tools and configurations. Here's a breakdown of the key components and how to set them up.

### Connecting Analytics and Sales Platforms

The first step is linking your email platform with your analytics and payment systems. PIMMS simplifies this process with native integrations to platforms like [Stripe (via the App Marketplace)](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/pimms) and Shopify—letting you track sales and attribute revenue to emails, regardless of which email tool you use.

- **Connect your payment processor** (e.g., Stripe or Shopify)
- **Link your email marketing platform**
- **Set up conversion goals** to track customer actions
- **Configure revenue attribution settings** for accurate reporting

### How UTM Parameters Work

UTM parameters are tracking codes added to your links that help identify traffic sources and conversions. Think of them as digital breadcrumbs that show which email campaigns are driving results. A well-constructed UTM-tagged link typically includes:

- **Source:** Indicates the origin of the traffic (e.g., email)
- **Medium:** Describes the method (e.g., newsletter, promotion)
- **Campaign:** Names the specific campaign
- **Content:** Differentiates between multiple links within the same campaign

These parameters work seamlessly with PIMMS, helping you gain deeper insights into your campaign performance.

### [PIMMS](https://pimms.io/) Link Tracking Setup

PIMMS provides advanced link tracking that goes beyond standard UTM parameters. With real-time analytics, it allows you to monitor engagement and revenue from your email campaigns. Key features include:

- **Direct app opening:** Links open directly in official mobile apps for a smoother user experience.
- **Advanced filtering:** Evaluate performance by UTM parameters, traffic source, device type, and location.
- **Real-time dashboard:** View clicks, conversions, and sales as they occur.

For accurate tracking, ensure your PIMMS setup includes:

- **Custom domain configuration** for professional link sharing
- **Integration with your existing marketing tools**
- **Team access settings** for collaborative monitoring
- **Defined conversion events** that align with your campaign goals

## Setting Up Revenue Tracking in PIMMS

### Creating Trackable Links with UTMs

PIMMS makes it easy to create trackable links using UTM parameters. Start by accessing the PIMMS dashboard and selecting 'New Link'. You'll need to include these essential UTM parameters:

- **Campaign name**: For example, "spring_sale_2025"
- **Source**: Such as "email"
- **Medium**: Like "newsletter" or "promotional"
- **Content identifier**: To differentiate between links in the same email

The platform allows you to include as many UTM parameters as needed, so you can track multiple variables within your campaigns. To keep your links short and aligned with your brand, set up a custom domain through PIMMS. Once your links are ready, add them directly to your email content.

### Adding Links to Your Emails

After generating your smart links in PIMMS, integrate them into any email platform for precise tracking. PIMMS also ensures a smooth user experience by directing recipients to the appropriate mobile apps instead of opening links in a mini-browser.

Here’s how to do it effectively:

- **Copy the full smart link** generated by PIMMS
- **Double-check UTM parameters** to ensure they’re correctly attached
- **Test the link** to confirm it opens in the intended mobile app

### Monitoring Campaign Performance

Once your smart links are live, tracking your campaign’s success is straightforward. PIMMS offers a real-time dashboard that provides insights into engagement and revenue metrics. You can track key data like click activity, conversion rates, and sales figures.

The platform also breaks down performance by factors such as geographic location, device type, traffic source, and browser. This detailed view helps you identify patterns, like higher conversion rates among mobile users or stronger results in specific regions. Real-time tracking lets you adjust campaigns immediately based on performance data. You can also filter results by UTM campaigns to pinpoint which email efforts are driving the most revenue.

For better campaign tracking, focus on these key areas:

- Monitor real-time conversion trends
- Attribute sales to specific campaign elements
- Analyze the customer journey from click to purchase

## Measuring Email Campaign Success

### Key Metrics to Track

Keep an eye on these metrics to gauge the success of your email campaigns:

- **Revenue per Email (RPE):** Total revenue divided by the number of emails sent.
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** Total revenue divided by the number of orders.
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** (Revenue - costs) / costs.
- **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of recipients who made a purchase.

PIMMS provides real-time tracking of these metrics through its analytics dashboard, automatically calculating them based on your campaign's performance. With the Pro plan, you can monitor up to $20,000 in monthly sales. Dive deeper into these numbers to uncover actionable insights for your campaigns.

### Analyzing Campaign Data

To refine your strategy, break down your campaign data and look for trends by device and location. PIMMS's filtering tools make it easy to spot revenue patterns.

**Device Performance**

- Compare conversion rates on mobile vs. desktop.
- Track sales generated through your mobile app.
- Analyze purchasing behavior across different operating systems.

**Geographic Analysis**

- Examine revenue by region to understand where your campaigns perform best.
- Pinpoint your top markets.
- Adjust campaign timing based on location-specific trends.

For example, conversion rates can vary significantly depending on the channel - LinkedIn reports a 76% conversion rate, while Google shows 1.6% [\[1\]](https://pimms.io).

### Ensuring Data Accuracy

Once you've analyzed your metrics, take these steps to ensure your data is accurate:

1\. **Data Validation**

- Cross-check PIMMS analytics with your e-commerce platform's data.
- Verify transaction amounts and how they’re attributed across systems.
- Look for unexpected changes in conversion patterns.

2\. **System Integration**

- Ensure mobile app redirects are working correctly.
- Confirm proper syncing of transactions with platforms like Stripe and Shopify.

## Tips for Better Revenue Tracking

Once your setup and performance monitoring are in place, you can improve the quality of your data with these specific strategies.

### UTM Naming Guidelines

Keeping UTM parameters consistent is key to accurate revenue tracking. Use these rules to keep your data organized:

**Campaign Source (utm_source)**

- Stick to lowercase letters and avoid spaces.
- Use clear, descriptive labels (e.g., newsletter, promotional, digest).
- Include the email platform name if relevant.

**Campaign Medium (utm_medium)**

- Use "email" for email campaigns.
- Be consistent with spelling.
- Avoid variations like "e-mail" or "mail."

**Campaign Name (utm_campaign)**

- Use hyphens instead of spaces.
- Add the date in the YYYY-MM format.
- Include the campaign type (e.g., promo, welcome, nurture).

For example: `?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2025-05-spring-sale`

### Fixing Attribution Gaps

Revenue tracking can get tricky with multi-touch attribution. Here’s how to manage common problems:

- **Cross-Device Tracking**: Ensure links are properly configured to track users across devices and apps.
- **Multiple Click Sources**: Preserve the original campaign attribution by tracking the first email click, recording subsequent clicks, and assigning conversion credit accurately.

### Testing Links for Better Results

Testing your links ensures your tracking works as expected. Here’s how:

- **Pre-Launch Verification**:

  - Test links on both iOS and Android devices.
  - Check functionality in desktop browsers.
  - Verify tracking works for forwarded emails.
  - Confirm app links open correctly.
  - Ensure UTM parameters are being tracked.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**:

  - Use tools like PIMMS's analytics dashboard to:
    - Watch click patterns.
    - Follow conversion paths.
    - Spot any tracking issues early.
