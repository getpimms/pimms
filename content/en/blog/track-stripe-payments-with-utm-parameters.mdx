UTM parameters help you track [Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments) payment conversions and connect your marketing campaigns directly to revenue. Here's what you need to know:

- **What Are UTM Parameters?**  
  Small codes added to URLs to track traffic sources and campaign performance (e.g., `utm_source=facebook`).
- **Why Use Them with Stripe?**  
  Measure ROI, optimize campaigns, and identify which efforts drive revenue.
- **How It Works:**

  1.  Add UTM parameters to your Stripe payment links.
  2.  Stripe logs these parameters during payment sessions.
  3.  View UTM data in Stripe's dashboard to see which campaigns generate sales.

- **Key UTM Parameters:**

  - `utm_source`: Traffic source (e.g., Google, Facebook).
  - `utm_medium`: Marketing channel (e.g., email, social).
  - `utm_campaign`: Campaign name (e.g., summer_sale_2025).
  - `utm_content`: Link variations (e.g., header_link).
  - `utm_term`: Keywords (e.g., running_shoes).

### Quick Setup:

1.  **Create Payment Links**: Add UTM parameters to your Stripe links.
2.  **Enable Redirects**: Set up a confirmation page URL for tracking.
3.  **Test & Verify**: Ensure UTM data flows through the payment process.

### UTM Parameter Types

UTM parameters are essential for tracking marketing performance in Stripe payment links. Each parameter captures specific details about the traffic source and campaign.

To ensure smooth functionality, UTM parameters should:

- Use only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores
- Stay within 150 characters
- Follow consistent naming patterns across all campaigns

Here's a quick breakdown of the key UTM parameters and their purposes:

| **Parameter**    | **Purpose**                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **utm_source**   | Identifies the platform driving traffic to the payment link |
| **utm_medium**   | Differentiates between traffic types, like paid vs. organic |
| **utm_campaign** | Tracks the performance of a specific marketing campaign     |
| **utm_content**  | Tests various placements of the payment link                |
| **utm_term**     | Monitors the effectiveness of search ads                    |

### How Stripe Processes UTM Data

Stripe automatically logs UTM parameters during payment sessions, making it easy to connect marketing efforts to revenue. Here's how it works:

1.  A customer clicks on a payment link containing UTM parameters, such as:

    ```
    https://buy.stripe.com/test_payment_link?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=spring_sale
    ```

2.  Stripe captures the UTM data during the session.
3.  This data is then attached to the payment details once the transaction is completed.
4.  You can view the UTM data directly in Stripe's reporting dashboard.

**Technical Setup Tips:**

- Ensure payment links redirect customers to confirmation pages.
- Double-check that UTM parameters are formatted correctly.
- Confirm that UTM values pass through the entire payment process without issues.
- Use tracking endpoints for redirect URLs to maintain accurate data flow.

If you're looking to simplify this process, PIMMS can help. It automates UTM parameter handling and integrates real-time analytics with Stripe. This means you can instantly see which campaigns are bringing in payments and revenue.

Next, let’s dive into the steps for setting up UTM parameters in Stripe for a seamless experience.

## Setting Up UTM Parameters in Stripe

### Manual UTM Setup

To make sure your Stripe payment links effectively track UTM parameters, follow these steps:

1\. **Configure Payment Link Settings**

Head to your Stripe Dashboard and go to the Payment Links section. When creating or editing a payment link, set the confirmation behavior to "redirect." This ensures UTM parameter tracking works as intended [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).

2\. **Structure Your Payment Link URL**

Build your payment link URL with the correct UTM parameters. For example:

```
https://buy.stripe.com/your-payment-link?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=spring_sale
```

Double-check that your URL includes the necessary UTM parameters in the right format.

3\. **Set Up Redirect Configuration**

In the 'After payment' field, enter the confirmation page URL. This step ensures customers are redirected while keeping UTM tracking intact [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).

## Payment Attribution Guidelines

To gain clear insights into revenue, setting up accurate payment attribution with proper UTM parameters is a must.

### UTM Parameter Setup Rules

Keep your UTM parameters concise - stick to under 150 characters and use only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

**Standard Naming for Payment Attribution**

| Channel | utm_source (e.g., facebook) | utm_medium (e.g., social/paid_social) | utm_campaign  | utm_content    |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Social  | platform name               | social/paid_social                    | campaign name | placement type |
| Email   | email/provider              | newsletter/promotional                | campaign date | CTA location   |
| Search  | google/bing                 | cpc/ppc                               | keyword group | ad variant     |

**Naming Conventions**

- Always use lowercase (e.g., "facebook" instead of "Facebook").
- Replace spaces with underscores (e.g., "summer_sale").
- Stick to consistent naming conventions across all campaigns.
- Add campaign dates in MMYYYY format (e.g., "may2025").

Once your parameters are set up, ensure they remain accurate and consistent throughout the payment process.

### UTM Data Verification

Regularly checking UTM parameters is crucial for maintaining accurate payment attribution.

**Initial Setup Testing**

Start by testing the entire payment flow. Create a sample transaction and confirm that UTM data shows up correctly on:

- Confirmation pages
- Stripe reports
- Your analytics platform

**Ongoing Monitoring**

Make weekly data quality checks part of your routine:

- Cross-check attribution data across platforms.
- Identify transactions missing UTM data.
- Ensure parameter consistency across campaigns.
- Verify that parameters stay intact through the payment flow.

For added reliability, consider using first-party cookies to store UTM parameters. This helps maintain accurate attribution, even if customers return later to finalize their purchase.

**Key Data Flow Steps:**

- Capture UTM parameters on landing pages.
- Ensure parameters persist through redirects.
- Pass parameters to Stripe during checkout.
- Record data accurately in your analytics platform.

## Analytics Integration

Once you've set up and verified your UTM parameters, the next step is integrating analytics to ensure every conversion is traced back to its source. A solid analytics system connects the dots between marketing campaigns and Stripe payments, tracking the entire customer journey.

### Data Flow Setup

When users click on campaign links, first-party cookies capture UTM data, ensuring attribution is preserved across sessions [\[2\]](https://www.ablecdp.com/blog/stripe-payment-links-tracking-a-comprehensive-guide).

Here’s how to configure your Stripe integration effectively:

| Component                | Configuration                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stripe Checkout**      | Enable "redirect" confirmation | Keeps UTM parameters intact in redirect URLs [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters)                               |
| **Cookie Storage**       | First-party implementation     | Ensures attribution continuity across sessions [\[2\]](https://www.ablecdp.com/blog/stripe-payment-links-tracking-a-comprehensive-guide) |
| **Webhook Endpoints**    | Data capture                   | Processes payment and UTM data                                                                                                           |
| **Server-side Tracking** | Privacy-compliant backup       | Collects data even with browser restrictions                                                                                             |

**Data Validation Process**

To maintain accurate data, implement automated checks that:

- Validate and monitor UTM parameters to ensure they remain intact.
- Cross-reference UTM values with your campaign database for consistency.
- Trigger alerts if parameters are missing or incorrectly formatted.
