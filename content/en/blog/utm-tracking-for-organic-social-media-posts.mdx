**Want to know which social media posts drive traffic and conversions? UTM tracking is the answer.** By adding small tags (UTM parameters) to your URLs, you can track where your visitors come from and how they engage with your content.

### Why Use UTM Tracking?

- **See What Works:** Identify which posts and platforms bring the most traffic.
- **Measure ROI:** Track clicks and conversions to understand campaign success.
- **Improve Strategy:** Use data to focus on high-performing platforms and content.

### How It Works:

Add UTM parameters like these to your URLs:

- **utm_source:** Platform (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn)
- **utm_medium:** Type of traffic (e.g., organic, social)
- **utm_campaign:** Campaign name (e.g., summer2025)
- **utm_content:** Specific link or post (e.g., bio_link, story_swipe)

Example:  
`yourdomain.com?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=summer2025&utm_content=bio_link`

### Tools Make It Easier:

## Creating UTM Parameters for Social Media

Building UTM parameters with clear components and consistent naming can lead to better insights from your campaigns.

### 5 Main UTM Parameters

UTM tracking uses five key parameters to identify traffic sources and measure campaign performance:

1.  **utm_source**: Shows where the traffic is coming from (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).
2.  **utm_medium**: Specifies the marketing medium (e.g., social, organic, post).
3.  **utm_campaign**: Names your marketing campaign (e.g., summer2025, productlaunch).
4.  **utm_term**: Tracks keywords used in paid campaigns (optional for organic posts).
5.  **utm_content**: Differentiates between similar content (e.g., link-bio, story-swipe).

### UTM Naming Guidelines

Consistent naming is crucial for accurate tracking and analysis. Follow these tips:

- Use lowercase letters to prevent tracking issues.
- Replace spaces with underscores or hyphens.
- Keep names concise but descriptive.
- Avoid using special characters.

For instance, a UTM for an organic Instagram post might look like this:

```
?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=summer2025&utm_content=feed_post
```

### UTM Link Creation Tools

Manually creating UTM links can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Tools like PIMMS simplify the process, offering features such as:

- Custom domain support for professional-looking links.
- Unlimited UTM parameter creation.
- Real-time conversion tracking.
- Direct app opening, which redirects users to official mobile apps instead of in-app browsers - reducing friction and boosting engagement.

PIMMS also includes an analytics dashboard that allows you to filter campaign performance by location, device type, browser, and channel attribution. This helps pinpoint your best-performing campaigns and provides insights to refine your social media strategy.

Up next, we’ll explore how to customize UTM setups for specific social platforms.

## UTM Setup by Social Platform

### Instagram UTM Tracking

Instagram's limited link placement options mean you need to adjust your UTMs based on where the link appears:

For links in your bio:

```
yourdomain.com/landing?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=bio_link&utm_campaign=summer2025
```

For story swipe-ups (available for accounts with 10,000+ followers):

```
yourdomain.com/product?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=story_swipe&utm_campaign=summer2025
```

For shoppable posts:

```
yourdomain.com/shop?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=shop_post&utm_campaign=summer2025
```

Now, let’s shift to LinkedIn, where a tailored approach is needed for its professional audience.

### LinkedIn UTM Tracking

LinkedIn's professional tone requires specific UTM strategies for both company content and employee-shared posts.

For posts from your company page:

```
yourdomain.com/blog?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=company_post&utm_campaign=q2_insights
```

For posts shared by employees as part of advocacy campaigns:

```
yourdomain.com/whitepaper?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=employee_share&utm_campaign=thought_leadership
```

To gain deeper insights into campaign performance, use PIMMS's advanced filtering tools. These help identify which sources and campaigns are driving the most growth.

### [TikTok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok) and [BeReal](https://bereal.com/en/) UTM Tracking

Platforms like TikTok and BeReal require UTMs tailored to their unique content styles and user behaviors:

For TikTok bio links:

```
yourdomain.com/offer?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=bio_link&utm_campaign=viral_series
```

For TikTok video descriptions:

```
yourdomain.com/landing?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=video_desc&utm_campaign=tutorial_series
```

For BeReal profile links:

```
yourdomain.com/special?utm_source=bereal&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=profile_link&utm_campaign=community
```

Since most traffic from these platforms comes from mobile users, ensure your links are mobile-friendly. PIMMS's app-opening feature can streamline the user experience by directing traffic straight into the relevant mobile apps, reducing friction and boosting conversions.
