You have two simple steps:

- Capture the PiMMs `clickId` on your form or booking page.
- Send the conversion data automatically to PiMMs via Zapier.

## Why integrate Zapier with PiMMs?

- **Real-time attribution:** See instantly which campaigns drive meetings or signups.

## How PiMMs conversion tracking works

Every link you create with PiMMs contains a unique **Click ID** (`clickId`) in the URL.

When someone clicks your link and books a meeting or submits a form, you pass that **clickId** into PiMMs through Zapier.

This allows PiMMs to attribute every conversion back to the original campaign, post, ad, or QR code — so you know exactly what’s working.

## ⚙️ Quick setup summary

| Integration | Where to capture Click ID | Zapier Trigger | Zapier Action |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Cal.com** | Add a Booking Question field (Short text) with identifier `pimms_id` and enable "Disable input if prefilled" | New Booking in Cal.com | Send conversion to PiMMs (clickId + meeting details) |
| **Tally.so** | Add a Hidden Field named `pimms_id` to capture the clickId from URL | New Form Submission in Tally | Send conversion to PiMMs (clickId + form details) |


> ✅ Pro Tip: Always create a test booking or form submission through your PiMMs link first to ensure the `clickId` is captured correctly.
