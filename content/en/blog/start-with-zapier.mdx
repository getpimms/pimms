Want to know exactly which links, campaigns, or QR codes actually lead to conversions — like booked meetings or form signups?

With the new **Zapier integration for PiMMs**, you can track conversions automatically from tools like **Cal.com** and **Tally** — no coding required.

This guide shows how to set up the integration and start capturing real lead data effortlessly.

## Why use Zapier with PiMMs?

Zapier lets you connect over 6,000 apps — and now you can send conversion events from those apps straight into PiMMs.

Use cases include:

- Tracking meetings booked via Cal.com
- Tracking form submissions from Tally
- Automatically linking conversions to the original click source

Once set up, PiMMs gives you real-time attribution data that tells you exactly what’s working.

## How It Works

Every smart link generated in PiMMs includes a unique `clickId`. This ID is automatically passed through the URL when someone visits your form or booking page.

When they convert — book a meeting, submit a form, etc. — you pass that `clickId` into PiMMs via Zapier.

This lets PiMMs attribute the conversion back to the original campaign, post, or QR code.

| **Tally.so** | Add a Hidden Field named `pimms_id` to capture click ID from URL | New Form Submission in Tally | Send conversion to PiMMs with clickId and eventName (e.g. "Form submitted") |
