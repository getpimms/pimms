## 1. Add the PiMMs tracking script

1. In Framer, go to your **site settings** â†’ **Custom Code**
2. Paste the following script in the **Head** section:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.inject-form.js"></script>
```

:::info
**Check if it's working (Optional)**

Open your website and type `window._pimmsAnalytics` in the browser console.  
If everything is installed correctly, you should see some values.

3. Publish your site

## 2. Build a PiMMs-compatible form

PiMMs auto-detects your fields â€” just follow this:

Add a **required email field**
- The field name must start with `email` (like `Email`, `email 1`, `e-mail perso`, etc.)

To track names:
- Use one field named `fullname`, `name`, etc.
- Or two fields: `firstname` and `lastname`

ðŸ‘‰ Check it by selecting the Input â†’ **Name**.

## 3. Get your Workspace ID

1. Log in to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Workspace ID**
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`)

## 3. Add the Framer webhook for form submissions

To setup a new form: [Framer Forms Guide](https://www.framer.com/features/forms/)

1. In Framer, select your form
2. Go to **Form** â†’ **Send to**
3. Choose **"Webhook"**
4. Use the following webhook URL:

```
https://app.pimms.io/api/framer/webhook?workspace_id=your-id
```

Replace `your-id` with your **Workspace ID**

Example:  

```
https://app.pimms.io/api/framer/webhook?workspace_id=ws_abc123xyz
```

## 4. Create your PiMMs tracking link

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a new short link pointing to your **Framer page**
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

**Example**:  

```
https://pim.ms/my-framer-site
```

Use this link in your ads, socials, emails, etc.

## 5. Test your setup

1. Open your PiMMs link in an **incognito tab**
2. Submit your Framer form
3. Check your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
4. You should see a new lead with full attribution

## 6. Troubleshooting tips

- Make sure the **script** is in the Head
- Double-check the **webhook URL** (including `workspace_id`)
- Use **incognito mode** and a new email to test
- Always use your **PiMMs link** to start the session â€” thatâ€™s how attribution works
