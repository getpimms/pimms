Want to attribute every Stripe Checkout sale to the exact click that caused it?

This guide shows you how to track **sale events** when using **Stripe Checkout** â€” the recommended method for most developers â€” with **PiMMs**.

ðŸ‘‰ Before continuing, make sure you understand the PiMMs attribution flow:  
ðŸ“˜ [How PiMMs tracks clicks, leads, and sales](/articles/introducing-conversion)

## What youâ€™ll achieve

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Automatically track when someone completes a Stripe Checkout  
- Attribute that sale to a PiMMs click  
- Link the conversion to a user or customer in your app  

PiMMs handles the heavy lifting â€” you just need to pass the right ID at the right moment.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you dive into code, make sure youâ€™ve completed the setup below:

- **Client-side tracking is live**  

See [Set up the PiMMs script or SDK on your site](/articles/introducing-conversion)

- **Your links have conversion tracking enabled**  

Either globally in **Workspace Settings**, or individually from the **Link Builder**.

- **Youâ€™ve installed the official PiMMs x Stripe integration**  

Follow the steps in the [Stripe setup guide](/articles/setup-stripe-for-website)

## 2. Use checkout sessions to track sales

If you're using `stripe.checkout.sessions.create`, just pass the right ID when creating the session.

This lets PiMMs associate the purchase with the original click and the correct user in your database.

Use the ID you used to create the conversion.

Example:

```js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe"

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com"
}

const pimms_id = req.cookies["pimms_id"]

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  customer_email: user.email,
  client_reference_id: "project_123",
  metadata: {
    // your internal user ID or email (the one used to create the conversion event)
    pimmsCustomerId: user.id 
  }
})
```

Thatâ€™s all.

## 3. Using Stripe Customers (alternative flow)

If you're **not** using Stripe Checkout sessions, you can still associate purchases by storing the data in the **Stripe Customer** object.

### Option A â€” During customer creation

Pass the `pimmsCustomerId` and `pimmsClickId` in the metadata:

```js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe"

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx"
}

const pimms_id = req.headers.get("pimms_id")

await stripe.customers.create({
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  metadata: {
    // your internal user ID or email (the one used to create the conversion event)
    pimmsCustomerId: user.id,
    // get the pimms_id from the cookie (recommended) or window.pimms_id
    pimmsClickId: pimms_id
  }
})
```

### Option B â€” Update existing customer

Same logic, but with `.update` instead of `.create`:

```js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe"

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx"
}

const pimms_id = req.headers.get("pimms_id")

await stripe.customers.update(user.id, {
  metadata: {
    // your internal user ID or email (the one used to create the conversion event)
    pimmsCustomerId: user.id,
    // get the pimms_id from the cookie (recommended) or window.pimms_id
    pimmsClickId: pimms_id
  }
})
```

âœ… This allows PiMMs to link future payments (invoices, renewals, etc.) to the original click.

## 4. What PiMMs tracks automatically

Once your integration is live, PiMMs will listen for key Stripe events:

- `checkout.session.completed` â€” primary sale trigger  
- `invoice.paid` â€” for subscriptions  
- `customer.created`, `customer.updated` â€” for ID mapping  
- `charge.refunded` â€” to handle refunds  

You donâ€™t need to manage any webhooks â€” PiMMs handles everything behind the scenes.

## Currency handling (soon)

Multi-currency support is coming soon.

For now, PiMMs automatically converts all amounts to USD using real-time exchange rates. Workspace-level currency preferences will be added shortly.

## What about Stripe Payment Links?

If you're using Stripe Payment Links instead of Checkout, follow this guide:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Track sales using Stripe Payment Links](/articles/setup-stripe-for-website)

## You're done ðŸŽ‰

Stripe Checkout is now fully connected to your PiMMs attribution flow.

Every sale is tied to the right link, campaign, and user â€” with zero manual effort.
