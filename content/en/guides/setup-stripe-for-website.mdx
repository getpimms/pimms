You have two ways to connect Stripe and PiMMs:

- **Option A:** Share tracked short links created with PiMMs (best for email, LinkedIn, social, etc.)
- **Option B:** Add PiMMs tracking on your website and keep Stripe buttons as-is

Letâ€™s go through it step by step.

## 1. Connect Stripe to PiMMs

1. Log in to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Integrations â†’ Stripe** and click **Enable**
3. Choose **Test** or **Production** mode

## 3. Share your payment link and track sales (2 options)

You have two main ways to track Stripe payments with PiMMs â€” depending on how the payment link is used.

### âœ… Option A: Use a PiMMs short link that points directly to Stripe

This is the **fastest and easiest way to get started**.

Use this when you want to share a **Stripe payment link directly** â€” without sending visitors to another web page first.

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io)  
2. Create a short link and paste your Stripe payment URL  
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

Youâ€™ll get a link like:

```
https://pim.ms/xyz
```

When someone clicks this link and completes the payment, PiMMs will automatically attribute the sale to the original link â€” with full statistics to follow.

### âœ… Option B: Trigger the Stripe payment from your website

Use this when the Stripe payment link is **triggered by a button click on your website**.

Hereâ€™s the key:  
**Donâ€™t embed a PiMMs short link directly in your siteâ€™s HTML.**

Why?  
Because all sales will be attributed to that same embedded link â€” **not to the original PiMMs link** that brought the visitor to your website.

ðŸ‘‰ What you want is to attribute the sale back to the PiMMs link that was originally clicked (from an ad, email, post, etc.).

To do that:

1. Use your normal Stripe payment link and **append this parameter**:

```html
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?pimms_client_reference_id=1">Buy now</a>
```

2. Include the PiMMs tracking script in your global HTML (typically in the `<head>` of your site):

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

Once this setup is done â€” youâ€™re all set âœ…

You can now generate **as many PiMMs short links as you want** pointing to your website.  
Each one will automatically track and attribute the sale correctly based on the visitorâ€™s original click.

## 4. See your Stripe sales in PiMMs

Every tracked sale will show up in your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io), with full attribution:

- Source (e.g. LinkedIn, Email, Ads)
- Channel
- Campaign
- Clicked link
