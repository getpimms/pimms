Want to track exactly where your sales and leads come from — on Framer, Webflow, Bubble or any no-code site?

With **PiMMs**, you can track every form, booking or Stripe sale — no code needed.  
This guide covers how to set up tracking on **supported tools only**:

- Calendars like **Cal.com**, **Lemcal**, **Calendly**
- Forms like **Tally**, **Typeform**, **iClosed**
- Stripe checkouts

## 1. Add PiMMs to your site

1. Go to your site’s **custom code settings** or head section  
2. Paste this script in the **Head**:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

:::info
**Check if it's working (Optional)**

Open your website and type `window._pimmsAnalytics` in the browser console.  
If everything is installed correctly, you should see some values.

3. Save and publish

✅ Works on builders like:
- Webflow ([full guide](/blog/how-to-track-webflow-leads))
- Framer ([full guide](/blog/how-to-track-framer))
- Bubble (soon)
- Wix (soon)
- Squarespace (soon)
- Lovable.dev (soon)
- Bold.new (soon)

If your builder supports global code (like Webflow Project Settings), paste the script once and it loads on every page.  
Otherwise, paste it manually on pages that include supported tools (form, booking, Stripe).

## 2. Set up buttons or links that redirect to supported tools

If your website includes buttons or links to tools like **Cal.com**, **Stripe**, **Tally**, or **Typeform**, you need to add a special PiMMs parameter to those links.

That’s how PiMMs connects the visit on your site to the conversion on the external tool.

### What to do

Update the link URL with the correct parameter:

- Use `?pimms_id=1` for calendars and forms (Cal.com, Lemcal, Calendly, Tally, Typeform, iClosed…)
- Use `?pimms_client_reference_id=1` for Stripe payment links

### Examples

**Calendar booking button**  
On your page:  
Book a call → `https://cal.com/your-user/demo?pimms_id=1`

**Typeform link**  
Apply now → `https://yourform.typeform.com/to/xyz?pimms_id=1`

**Stripe payment**  
Buy now → `https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123?pimms_client_reference_id=1`

These parameters are required so PiMMs can match the visitor session on your website with the final conversion.

Make sure the link is on a page that includes the PiMMs script.
