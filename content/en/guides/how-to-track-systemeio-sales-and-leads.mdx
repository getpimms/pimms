Tip: only one script is needed for Systeme.io ‚Äî PiMMs auto-tracks your funnel visitors.

## 2. Get your Workspace ID

1. Log in to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Workspace ID**
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`)

## 3. Add the Systeme.io webhook

1. In Systeme.io, go to your profile ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Scroll down to **Webhooks**
3. Click **Create**
4. Set it up like this:
- **Name**: PiMMs Webhook  
- **Webhook URL**:  
  ```
  https://app.pimms.io/api/systemeio/webhook?workspace_id=your-id
  ```
  *(Replace `your-id` with your actual Workspace ID)*  
- **Secret**: Your Workspace ID  
- **Events**:  
  ‚úÖ `Opt-in`  
  ‚úÖ `New sale`

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the URL and Secret both use the exact same Workspace ID.

## 4. Add `pimms_id=1` to your funnel links

To track leads and sales accurately, add this tracking parameter to **links that point to a page with a lead form**:

`?pimms_id=1`

### Example

`https://yourfunnel.systeme.io/step-lead-form-2?pimms_id=1`

To update your links:

1. Click **Edit page**  
2. Select the **button** or **link**  
3. Append `?pimms_id=1` to the destination URL

**Tip**: Only add `?pimms_id=1` to **links** that lead to a **page with a form** (newsletter, opt-in, lead magnet‚Ä¶).

Don‚Äôt use it on links that go to pages without a form ‚Äî it is useless.

## 5. Create your PiMMs tracking link

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a new short link pointing to the **first step** of your Systeme.io funnel
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/my-sales-funnel
```

Use this link in your ads, emails, socials ‚Äî everywhere you get traffic.

## 6. Test your setup

1. Open your PiMMs link in an **incognito tab**
2. Go through your funnel (opt-in + sale if applicable)
3. Use a test email (like `test+pimms@yourdomain.com`)
4. Check your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see a new lead and, if applicable, a new sale ‚Äî both with full attribution.
