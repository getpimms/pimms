Want to track exactly where your Tally.so form submissions come from?

## 1. Create a new hidden field in your form

1. Log in to your **Tally.so dashboard**
2. Open the **form** you want to track and click **Edit**
3. Add a new **hidden field**

5. Publish the form

## 2. Create your PiMMs tracking link

1. Go to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link pointing to your **Tally form URL**
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/my-form
```

## 3. Submit a test form

1. Open your PiMMs link in a new tab  
2. Fill out your Tally form using a fake email (e.g. `test+zapier@yourdomain.com`)

This lets Zapier detect your form fields and pick up the `pimms_id`.

## 4. Connect Tally.so to PiMMs in Zapier

1. Go to [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
2. Create a new Zap manually

### Trigger setup

- **App**: Tally  
- **Event**: New Submission  
- Connect your Tally account

- **Email** â†’ form email field  
- **External ID** â†’ same as email  
- **Name** â†’ full name field if available

## 6. Troubleshooting tips

- The `pimms_id` must be present in the URL when users open the form
- Use **Zapier Task History** to debug issues
- Only the **first submission** per email is tracked as a conversion
- Check that your Zap is **published and turned on**

## Best ways to share your Tally form

### Option A â€” Share a PiMMs short link

Perfect for socials, ads, QR codes, or newsletters.

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link for your form
3. Enable **conversion tracking**
4. Share it everywhere

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/feedback
```

### Option B â€” Embed your Tally form on your website

Add this script to your site `<head>`:
```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

:::info
**Check if it's working (Optional)**

Open your website and type `window._pimmsAnalytics` in the browser console.  
If everything is installed correctly, you should see some values.
:::

Then make sure to **append the `pimms_id`** to the Tally form URL.

**Example**:  
```
https://tally.so/r/nAbCdE?pimms_id=1
```

If you embed it using an iframe, make sure to use the full URL with `?pimms_id=...`
