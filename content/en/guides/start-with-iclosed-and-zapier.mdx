Want to track exactly where your iClosed bookings come from?

With **PiMMs + Zapier**, it only takes a few minutes â€” no code needed.

## 1. Create your PiMMs tracking link

1. Go to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link pointing to your iClosed calendar page
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/my-booking-page
```

## 2. Book a test meeting

1. Open your PiMMs link in a new tab  
2. Book a test meeting using a fake email (e.g. `test+zapier@yourdomain.com`)

This is needed so Zapier can detect the form fields and tracking ID.

## 3. Connect iClosed to PiMMs in Zapier

1. Go to [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
2. Create a new Zap manually

### Trigger setup

- **App**: iClosed  
- **Event**: Meeting Booked  
- Connect your iClosed account  
- Select your test booking from step 2

- **External ID** â†’ attendeeâ€™s email  
- **Name** â†’ attendeeâ€™s name

## 5. Troubleshooting tips

- If someone books multiple times using the same email, only the first meeting is counted as a conversion.
- Make sure the `pimms_id` field is correctly passed through the URL.
- Check that your Zap is published and active.
- Look at **Zapier Task History** if a step fails.

## Best ways to share your iClosed booking form

Use this if you're sharing your iClosed link via email, ads, QR codes, or social media.

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io)

3. Enable conversion tracking
4. Share the link wherever you want

**Example**:  
```

```

### Option B â€” Use iClosed on your website

Add this script in your siteâ€™s or page `<head>` in all the pages of your website: 

``` html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

<LinkCard
  href="/freetools/site-checker"
  title="Verify your script installation"
  description="Use our free tool to automatically check if the PiMMs analytics script is properly installed on your website."
/>

Add `?pimms_id=1` at the end of your iClosed URL:

**Example**:
```
https://app.iclosed.io/e/xyz?pimms_id=1
```
