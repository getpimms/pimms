      "description": "Here are the questions we get most often before users get started.",
      "faq1": {
        "question": "What makes PIMMS different from a regular link?",
        "answer": "PIMMS redirects directly to the official mobile app (Instagram, YouTube, etc.), instead of opening in a built-in mini browser. That means less friction, more engagement — and more conversions."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "Why should I trust PIMMS?",
        "answer": "PIMMS is designed to be simple, fast, and powerful. You can create unlimited smart links, even on a small budget. And if anything goes wrong, our support team is available 7 days a week — no tickets, no hassle."
      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "Do I need to install anything?",
        "answer": "Nope. PIMMS is 100% online. Just create, share, and we’ll handle the redirect."
      },
      "faq4": {
        "question": "Does it work with all platforms and tools?",
        "answer": "Yes, over 100 platforms: LinkedIn, Insta, TikTok, Notion, Calendly, YouTube… You share the link, we take care of the rest."
      },
      "faq5": {
        "question": "Can I track clicks and conversions?",
        "answer": "Yes, even on the free plan. You’ll see how many people clicked — and more importantly, how many actually did what you wanted: filled out a form, booked a call, bought something, subscribed… That’s a conversion: when a click turns into a real result. You also track where it came from (platform, campaign, channel…) and how it evolves over time. Clear, simple, effective."
      },
      "faq6": {
        "question": "Is the lifetime offer really going away?",
        "answer": "Yes. It’s limited to early adopters. Once the quota is reached, it will be replaced with a standard pricing model."
      },
      "faq7": {
        "question": "Is it secure?",
        "answer": "Yes. PIMMS follows the best security practices. No unnecessary tracking, no data reselling. Your data (and your audience’s) stays safe."
      },
      "faq8": {
        "question": "I have zero tech skills — is that a problem?",
        "answer": "Not at all. PIMMS is built for non-tech users. You can create a link in two clicks, and connect tools like Notion or Calendly in seconds. No code needed."
      },
      "faq9": {
        "question": "How is PIMMS different from a basic link shortener?",
        "answer": "A classic short link just redirects. PIMMS does much more: it tracks conversions, lets you organize links by campaign, channel, or usage, and gives you clean dashboards — without complex setup. You know exactly what works, and why."
      },
      "faq10": {
        "question": "How is PIMMS different from Google Analytics?",
        "answer": "Google Analytics helps you analyze what happens on your website. It shows you where your visitors come from and what they do once they land. But it doesn’t track what happens outside your site — like a Tally form, a Calendly link, a YouTube video, or a link shared in a mobile app. And it often requires complex setup (goals, tags, GTM…). PIMMS, on the other hand, lets you track all your conversions — both on your site and beyond — using our SDK or simple 1-click integrations. You create a link, share it, and instantly see what it generated: clicks, conversions, revenue. No friction. No overkill."

      "heading": "Running a YouTube channel?",
      "description": "Here are the most common questions we get from creators who use PIMMS to grow their channel.",
      "faq1": {
        "question": "How is PIMMS different from a regular YouTube link?",
        "answer": "When you share a YouTube link, it often opens in an in-app browser (like on Instagram or LinkedIn). PIMMS redirects straight to the official YouTube app instead. That means a smoother experience, more views, and more subscribers."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "Can I track who clicks on my YouTube links?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can see how many people clicked your link, where they came from, and what device they used. Even on the free plan, you get clean, useful insights to understand your traffic."
      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "Can PIMMS help me get more subscribers?",
        "answer": "Yes. Since users land directly in the YouTube app (and are already logged in), it's easier for them to subscribe. Fewer steps, less friction, better conversion."
      },
      "faq4": {
        "question": "Can I create a link for each video or playlist?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You can create as many smart links as you want—for individual videos, Shorts, playlists, livestreams, or your channel homepage."
      },
      "faq5": {
        "question": "Can I see which links perform best?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can track the number of clicks and see where they came from (social platform, device, country, etc.). While PIMMS doesn’t track YouTube subscriptions directly, this data helps you understand what actually drives engagement."
      },
      "faq6": {
        "question": "Does PIMMS work with other platforms?",
        "answer": "Yes. Share your PIMMS links on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn, or even in newsletters. Your audience will always be redirected to the right place automatically."
      },
      "faq7": {
        "question": "Do I need to connect my YouTube account or install anything?",
        "answer": "Nope. No login, no integration needed. You just create your link, share it, and we take care of the rest."
      },
      "faq8": {
        "question": "Is it safe for me and my audience?",
        "answer": "Yes. PIMMS follows strong security practices and doesn’t collect or resell unnecessary personal data. Whether you’re a solo creator or part of a team, your data is protected."
      },
      "faq9": {
        "question": "How is PIMMS different from a simple link shortener?",
        "answer": "PIMMS doesn’t just shorten links—it makes them smarter. It detects the user’s platform and device, and opens the YouTube app directly. You also get full click tracking and analytics without the complexity."
      },
      "faq10": {
        "question": "How is this different from YouTube Analytics?",
        "answer": "YouTube Analytics shows you what happens *inside* YouTube. PIMMS shows you what happens *before* that—who clicked, where they came from, and which link drove the view. It’s 100% complementary."
      }
    },
    "amazon": {
      "title": "Answers to your questions",
      "heading": "Selling on Amazon?",
      "description": "Here are the most common questions people ask before using PIMMS to boost their Amazon sales and reviews.",
      "faq1": {
        "question": "What makes PIMMS different from a regular Amazon link?",
        "answer": "When you share a link to a product or book on Amazon, it often opens in a small in-app browser (like Instagram or Facebook). PIMMS redirects users straight to the official Amazon app. The result? A smoother shopping experience, more sales, and more positive reviews."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "Can I track who clicks on my Amazon links?",
        "answer": "Yes. You’ll see how many people clicked, where they came from (social networks, newsletters, etc.), and what they did next (add to cart, purchase, etc.). Even on the free plan, you get clear, detailed insights."
      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "Can PIMMS help me increase sales?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. By sending shoppers directly to the official Amazon app (instead of a web browser), you reduce friction. Customers are already signed in to their Amazon account, so it’s just one tap to buy or leave a review. Fewer steps mean higher conversions."
      },
      "faq4": {
        "question": "Can I create a link for each product or book?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can create as many smart links as you want—whether for different products, Kindle books, your Amazon store page, or specific promotions."
      },
      "faq5": {
        "question": "Can I see which links perform best?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can see how many people clicked each link and where they came from (platform, device, country, etc.). While PIMMS doesn’t track every detail of a purchase, this info lets you see which channels truly bring in conversions."
      },
      "faq6": {
        "question": "Does PIMMS also work on other platforms?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can share PIMMS links anywhere—social networks, newsletters, blogs, and more. The link adapts based on the platform, always sending users to the right place."
      },
      "faq7": {
        "question": "Do I need to connect my Amazon account or install anything?",
        "answer": "No. There’s no need to connect to your Amazon account or install scripts. You simply create a link, share it, and PIMMS automatically sends your customers to the official Amazon app."
      },
      "faq8": {
        "question": "Is it safe for me and my customers?",
        "answer": "Yes. We don’t collect unnecessary personal data or resell any information. PIMMS follows strong security practices for solo sellers or larger teams."
      },
      "faq9": {
        "question": "How is PIMMS different from a basic link shortener?",
        "answer": "PIMMS doesn’t just shorten links—it detects the user’s platform, device, and browser to smartly redirect them to the Amazon app. You also get click analytics and performance metrics, so you can optimize your efforts based on real data."
      },
      "faq10": {
        "question": "What about Amazon Analytics or Amazon Associates?",
        "answer": "Amazon Analytics shows you what happens *on* Amazon once people arrive. PIMMS shows you what happens *before* that—who clicked, where they came from, which link or campaign drove the click. They work perfectly together."
      }
    }
